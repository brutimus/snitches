With federal justice officials closely watching, Orange County lawmakers have little choice but to expand the local Office of Independent Review to review the county’s growing jailhouse informant controversy, the chairman of the Board of Supervisors said Monday.

In a packed conference room, the county’s two-member oversight committee – Chairman Todd Spitzer and Supervisor Andrew Do – talked about expanding the oversight office beyond the Sheriff’s Department to include the district attorney and other county agencies.

Spitzer and Do, both former prosecutors, said a centralized office could look at the county’s informant crisis and accusations that prosecutors and police illegally used jailhouse snitches and withheld evidence.

“We now are embroiled in significant events on our watch ... when I have the U.S. Department of Justice asking me and the county counsel what we’re doing with the Office of Independent Review,” Spitzer said. “Things have been happening in this county behind the scenes for a long, long time that have great impact on the Board of Supervisors.”

Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas and his staff were noticeably absent among the high-level officials from other county departments who attended Monday’s meeting.

Susan Kang Schroeder, the district attorney’s chief of staff, said the committee’s actions appeared more about politics than public accountability.

“These are complex legal issues involving the separation of powers and the powers of the prosecutor,” Schroeder said. “What these hearings are about is more of the same power grab by Todd Spitzer, who is desperate to run the District Attorney’s Office.”

Spitzer responded: “Tony Rackauckas is part of that old school mentality that there’s no oversight or accountability for law enforcement in Orange County. Sheriff (Sandra) Hutchens, on the other hand, has brought in a whole new wave of openness.”

The Board of Supervisors, Orange County’s five-member governing body, so far has not taken any action during the nearly two years since accusations first surfaced in court that the District Attorney’s Office, Sheriff’s Department and other police agencies had used a surreptitious network of jailhouse snitches to obtain incriminating statements from defendants represented by attorneys, a violation of federal law.

Police and prosecutors also faced allegations that they withheld information from defense teams.

Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders made the accusations while defending mass murderer Scott Dekraai, who pleaded guilty to killing eight people at a hair salon in Seal Beach.

Sanders’ efforts prompted a Superior Court judge in March to remove the district attorney’s 250-lawyer staff from the penalty phase of the Dekraai case.

More cases are under scrutiny.

At Monday’s meeting, Spitzer credited the local Public Defender’s Office with raising “some of the most significant and fundamental questions about the lack of transparency in Orange County.”

“We have not faced this level of scrutiny at any time of my (tenure) in Orange County,” said Spitzer, who was fired from the District Attorney’s Office in 2010 and was elected to the Board of Supervisors for the second time in 2012.

On Monday, Public Defender Frank Ospino asked that his office not be included under the proposed model for a larger Office of Independent Review.

“The Public Defender’s Office is the one who exposed the issues,” Ospino said.

Special counsel Mike Gennaco, a former federal prosecutor who worked with Fullerton police on the backlash from the high-profile death of Kelly Thomas, proposed the centralized oversight office.

Rackauckas created his own panel of outside experts to look at his office’s use of informants, and Hutchens has internal investigators doing the same.

Meanwhile, the state Attorney General’s Office has its own investigation.

Gennaco noted the lack of coordination: “Everybody is moving in their own, independent direction. ... People aren’t working together.”

Spitzer and Do are expected to make a recommendation to the full Board of Supervisors early next month.
