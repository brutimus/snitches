<h1>Chapter 2</h1>

<blockquote><p>You shouldn't be meeting that guy anywhere.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>
<p>Earlier that day, Michelle Fournier packed a lunch for her son Dominic, then drove the second-grader from her Garden Grove home to McGaugh Elementary School in Seal Beach. She had two adult children from a first marriage but Dominic was her baby, and the bubbly 48-year-old doted on the boy whose custody and time <a title="she reluctantly shared with her ex-husband Dekraai" href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/fournier-321952-dekraai-court.html" target="_blank">she reluctantly shared with her ex-husband Dekraai</a>. She particularly loved to cut Dominic&rsquo;s hair herself, but the custody disputes had become so bitter and petty that Dekraai would take the boy to someone else for a haircut just to spite her. On Oct. 12, as the 7:55 a.m. bell sounded, Dominic marched off to class, his black school bag slung over his shoulder. Fournier watched him go, then left to get ready for work at nearby Salon Meritage.</p>
<p>Mother and son would never see each other again.</p>
<p>Not long afterward, Salon Meritage began coming to life for the day. Stylist Jeffery Segall arrived to help open up, followed by <a title="his friend and colleague Victoria Buzzo" href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/buzzo-321948-mandri-beach.html" target="_blank">his friend and colleague Victoria Buzzo</a>, who burst in wearing one of her signature splashy outfits. This time it was black shorts and a white blouse, with her hair tied up in a twist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to tap dance for us?&rdquo; Segall joked. Buzzo cracked up.</p>
<p>Another stylist, Gordon Gallego, arrived to have his own hair cut by Buzzo before his first customer walked in. Just as doctors make difficult patients, hair stylists can have a hard time sitting in the chair passively, and Gallego and Buzzo always turned their session into a good-natured battle royale. She loved doing his hair &ldquo;her way,&rdquo; Gallego would remember at Buzzo&rsquo;s memorial service. &ldquo;It was always an event,&rdquo; Segall added.</p>
<p>Gradually Salon Meritage settled into its Wednesday morning routine. Paul Wilson, husband of <a title="Meritage manicurist Christy Lynne Wilson" href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/criswell-321955-salon-wilson.html" target="_blank">Meritage manicurist Christy Lynne Wilson</a>, came by for a 10:30 a.m. haircut with Gallego. <a title="Meritage owner Randy Fannin" href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/randy-321883-sandy-hair.html" target="_blank">Meritage owner Randy Fannin</a> and his wife, Sandy, brought in some supplies for the shop. The salon&rsquo;s regular customers began strolling in for their appointments.</p>
<p>Hattie Stretz of Los Alamitos, a lively presence at age 73, arrived to have her nails done by <a title="her daughter, newlywed Laura Webb Elody" href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/eskenazi-321925-webb-took.html" target="_blank">her daughter, newlywed Laura Webb Elody</a>. Stretz was popular with the other stylists and often brought homemade pies to the shop.</p>
<p>Fournier came in next, offering her coworkers half a lemon cake with cheese cream frosting, a leftover from a treat she had baked for her adult son, Chad. Fournier was popular at the salon, the kind of stylist customers came back to see year in and year out. &ldquo;She could gab away. She was one of those girlfriends you could never get enough of,&rdquo; recalled salon client Kari Salveson. She had been coming to have Fournier do her hair for a decade and had a simple explanation for that loyalty: &ldquo;She made you smile and she made you laugh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Fournier&rsquo;s friends and coworkers knew all about her troubles with her ex-husband. They had been married only three years after a whirlwind romance. They had been great as boyfriend-girlfriend, one friend observed, but terrible as husband-wife. Fournier left him in 2006, before his crippling accident in 2007. It was Dekraai who filed for divorce. Since then, he had come by the salon more than once to fight with her right in front of the staff and customers. She had complained of his &ldquo;manic&rdquo; desire to control every aspect and minute of Dominic&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>The salon workers made for a close-knit group, like an extended family, and the other stylists did not care for Dekraai. Buzzo once shoved him out the door. That Wednesday, Fournier told her colleagues that her ex-husband had asked her to meet him for coffee. &ldquo;Can you believe that?&rdquo; she marveled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/salon-373768-meritage-beach.html">I hope you said &lsquo;no,&rsquo;</a>&rdquo; Gallego responded. &ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t be meeting that guy anywhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As lunchtime approached, customers left the salon and others arrived. Seal Beach <a title="youth soccer volunteer Michele Fast" href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/fast-322981-beach-children.html" target="_blank">youth soccer volunteer Michele Fast</a> had to cut short a phone call with her mother so she could make her haircut appointment at Meritage. A mother of three, Fast was well-known and well-liked in The Hill area of Seal Beach, where the 47-year-old could be seen every day on her brisk walks through the neighborhood with her Labrador. This would be her first time patronizing Salon Meritage.</p>
<p>Hattie Stretz, meanwhile, decided to linger at the salon, extending her nail work into a hairdo. While her daughter Laura did the styling, Stretz chatted with her salon favorite, Buzzo. Those two always chattered together like old friends. Manicurist Christy Wilson then decided to take advantage of a lull to slip into Fournier&rsquo;s chair for a wash and cut.</p>
<p>Sometime around 1 p.m. Segall&rsquo;s last client of the day canceled. He had planned to stay all afternoon, but now could cut loose, yet another fateful decision that day. &ldquo;The weather is beautiful,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to enjoy it.&rdquo; He heard laughter as he walked out the door &ndash; the mood at Salon Meritage was frequently joyful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See you tomorrow, buddy,&rdquo; salon owner Fannin called after him, because that&rsquo;s what he always said in farewell.</p>
<p>About 15 minutes later, at 1:21 p.m., a balding, hulking, overweight man wearing a bulletproof vest walked into the salon. Scott Dekraai came armed with <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/salon-321997-killing-beach.html?graphics">three powerful handguns</a> &ndash; a 9 mm Springfield, a Smith &amp; Wesson .44 Magnum, and a Heckler &amp; Koch .45 &ndash; and plenty of ammunition stuffed in the pockets of his cargo pants.</p>
<p>It would be over in two minutes.</p>
