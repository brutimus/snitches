<p>More than three dozen legal experts and ex-prosecutors on Wednesday called for a federal investigation into allegations that Orange County prosecutors and sheriff’s officials improperly used jailhouse informants and withheld evidence from defense attorneys.</p>
<p>The group, including former Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti and former Chief Assistant United States Attorney Richard Drooyan, penned a letter to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch calling attention to a “crisis” in the county’s justice system.</p>
<p>“Compelling evidence of pervasive police and prosecutorial misconduct in Orange County ... has caused us grave concern,” they wrote in the 25-page letter. (<a href="http://files.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/docs/Request_for_Federal_Investigation_in_Orange_County_11.17.15.pdf" target="_blank" title="You can read the letter here">You can read the letter here</a>.)</p>
<p>“It is fair to say that the criminal justice system in Orange County is in a state of crisis: charges in extremely serious cases have been reduced or dismissed; violent crimes – including murders – have gone entirely uninvestigated; to date, four law enforcement officers have refused to testify in pending criminal matters, citing their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination; and at least one prosecutor has been found by a court to have given ‘incredible’ testimony under oath. More troubling still, this all appears to be the tip of the iceberg.”</p>
<p>Susan Kang Schroeder, chief of staff for Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas, said the letter seemed to be cobbled from defense legal briefs and what she characterized as inaccurate news accounts, not from the complete court filings.</p>
<p>“Our position has always been, and will continue to be, we welcome any scrutiny and input from any law enforcement agency who wants to come in,” Schroeder said.</p>
<p>Sheriff Sandra Hutchens also said her agency would cooperate with any federal investigation, although she added it would be prudent to wait for the outcome of the state probe.</p>
<p>Hutchens said her department has learned from its mistakes. “During the court proceedings over the last several months, we have identified and <img align="bottom" src="http://ngweb.freedom.local:7003/newsgate/images/SmallCode.png">acknowledged operational deficiencies and responded with immediate corrective action to include revised policies and improved training,” she said.</p>
<p>The office of California Attorney General Kamala Harris is investigating local prosecutors and police over the use of informants at Rackauckas’ request.</p>
<p>The group of legal heavy-hitters is making the latest push for federal authorities to probe the two-year controversy over <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/sanders-684780-attorney-case.html" target="_blank" title="complaints">complaints</a> that Orange County authorities systematically misused informants<a> </a>to illegally coax confessions from jail inmates who are represented by lawyers. Defense attorneys also have accused police and prosecutors of withholding background information on the informants and other evidence favorable to their clients.</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Justice attorneys indicated they are “keeping an eye” on Orange County’s snitch controversy, according to correspondence between County Counsel Leon Page and the department’s civil rights division.</p>
<p>Among those signing the letter was former California Attorney General John Van de Kamp, who said the federal government no longer should watch from the sidelines.</p>
<p>“Failure to turn over exculpatory evidence can lead to wrongful convictions. Without a comprehensive investigation, we’ll never know how many convictions were wrongfully obtained in Orange County,” Van de Kamp said. “At the same time, serious cases there appear to have been minimized by or tainted by the practices of the two agencies. In one case a defendant sentenced to life without parole for murder now faces less than four years in prison because of law enforcement misconduct.”</p>
<p>He was referring to the case against convicted killer Leonel Vega, who faced a life sentence. Instead, prosecutors offered him a 15-year plea deal in February because of allegations that jailhouse snitches were improperly used against him. With time served, Vega effectively received a four-year sentence.</p>
<p>Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Irvine School of Law, also signed Wednesday’s letter and previously called for the U.S. Department of Justice to get involved. So did The New York Times editorial board.</p>
<p>In March, <a href="http://www.ocregister.com/articles/goethals-669116-judge-case.html" target="_blank" title="Judge Thomas Goethals">Superior Court Judge Thomas Goethals</a> cited concerns that the district attorney could not guarantee a fair trial for Scott Dekraai, who confessed to gunning down eight people at a Seal Beach salon in 2011. Goethals removed the office’s 250 lawyers from the death penalty trial, the largest mass murder case in Orange County history. The state attorney general is appealing the ruling.</p>
