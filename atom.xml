	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eighteen years ago, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/death-289117-sentenced-miller.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;John Abel&quot;&gt;John Abel&lt;/a&gt; looked the part of unrepentant killer. He grinned and twiddled his thumbs as a judge &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/abel-345594-death-miller.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;sentenced him to death&quot;&gt;sentenced him to death&lt;/a&gt; for the 1991 murder of a merchant’s son outside of a Tustin bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Abel has maintained his innocence. Now he is an exhibit in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/sanders-684780-attorney-case.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders’ 752-page court&quot;&gt;Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders’ 752-page court&lt;/a&gt; filing in August alleging decades of misconduct by Orange County prosecutors and law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At issue is the state’s star witness: Lorraine Ripple, Abel’s former crime partner, who was serving a more than five-decade sentence when she testified. She told the jury that Abel had confessed to the Tustin shooting a few months after it happened.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brutimus.github.io/snitches/articles/inside-snitch-tank-pt2&quot;&gt;Inside the 'snitch tank' Part 2: How the jailhouse informant controversy affects a Death Row murder case&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abel’s appellate attorneys, Michael Belter and Michael Lasher, say Ripple’s testimony was tainted by undisclosed benefits, including a transfer to a federal prison, that she expected to receive as a result of her cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The transfer never materialized, though Ripple did get another unusual perk: regular deliveries of snacks and toiletry items, and hundreds of dollars in money orders, from the Tustin detective who headed up the case. Some of the money came out of his own pocket, and the packages were arriving eight years after the Abel trial ended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Orange County District Attorney’s Office says the claims of legal consideration for Ripple, now 66, are untrue and that investigators had other compelling evidence against Abel, now 71 and housed at San Quentin State Prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But there’s another twist in the case: Ripple now says she lied about Abel’s role in the murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I can honestly say that John never told me that he shot anybody,” Ripple said in a 2011 statement taken by Abel’s defense team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Abel case stands out among those included in Sanders’ complaints against the Orange County District Attorney’s Office because it doesn’t involve a snitch who collected information in jail. It involves the intense and long-running cultivation of a former crime partner-turned-informant, destined to spend the rest of her life in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But thousands of pages of records filed in Abel’s pending habeas corpus appeal with the California Supreme Court don’t answer with certainty the crucial question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When was Ripple telling the truth – and when was she lying?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LYING IN WAIT &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Jan., 4, 1991, Armando Miller, 26, withdrew $20,000 from a Sunwest Bank in Tustin, a routine withdrawal he made on behalf of his family’s Alameda Market in Orange. As he left, a man in the bank’s parking lot walked up to Miller, shot him in the head and left with a paper bag. The money was never recovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trail for Miller’s killer grew cold until four years later, when Tustin detective Tom Tarpley reopened the investigation. A 2-year-old tip naming Abel as the killer led the detective to Ripple, one of Abel’s former crime partners, who was serving a 45-year sentence at Valley State Prison for Women on armed robbery convictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview with the investigator, Ripple said that Abel had told her about killing Miller, that he had used a .22, that he knew Miller made large withdrawals and that he was lying in wait in the parking lot. She said he even gave her the murder weapon, which she traded for drugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her letters to Tarpley indicate she was willing to testify. Other documents suggest she was reluctant to help until she claimed prison officials turned up the heat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 1995, the prison decided to relocate Ripple from a security housing unit – where she was confined after getting caught with an ice pick – and put her in general population, where she had enemies she feared would kill her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Officials did not say in the record why they decided to end her indeterminate disciplinary sentence. But documents quote Ripple complaining that the prison warden, Lewis Kuykendall, gave her an ultimatum in June 1995: Refuse to cooperate with Orange County authorities and get moved to general population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ripple said a prison lieutenant tried to sweeten the deal, telling her that if she cooperated, she would get her a transfer to California Institution for Women in San Bernardino County, which was much closer to her grandchildren.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The choice was I would either testify for Orange County and transfer to CIW … or I would be stuck (at Valley State) back with the same people that I had major run-ins with,” she later said. Ripple said she refused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a prison committee approved the move to general population in September 1995, Ripple flew into a rage and shoved a prison guard. Prosecutors in Madera County, where Valley State is located, charged her with battery. She later entered a plea deal that got her an extra eight years in prison – and kept her in the security housing unit. She eventually agreed to testify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Her statements about the alleged ultimatum were contained in California Department of Corrections and Madera County court records. Those records never made it to Abel’s trial team, which could have used the information to argue that Ripple had ulterior motives for testifying. Orange County prosecutors and Tustin police later said they did not know about the statements, which prison officials denied making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The California Attorney General’s Office, which handles death row appeals for county prosecutors, said in its 2010 Supreme Court filings that the District Attorney’s Office had “no duty to ferret out impeachment information possessed by an agency or individual not part of the prosecution team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;LOBBYING BEGINS &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Abel’s trial, Ripple testified that the only benefit she’d been promised for testifying was a temporary, one-year transfer to the California Institution for Women. She told jurors she expected to return after that to the difficult conditions at Valley State.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the trial ended in June 1997, however, Ripple and authorities began lobbying prison officials for a transfer to the federal prison system, records show. Two months after the trial, the Orange County District Attorney’s Office put the request in writing, according to Department of Corrections records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their reason: Another female inmate had distributed documents from the Abel case showing Ripple had snitched. Ripple would never be safe in California prisons, given Abel’s prison gang connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There is very little the system can do to him if he has Ms. Ripple killed,” Tarpley, the Tustin detective, wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Based on the notoriety of her crime partner, it would be difficult or impossible for her” to remain in the general prison population, Kuykendall, the warden, wrote in November 1997 to a department committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the next month, the California Department of Corrections’ board denied her transfer to the federal system, saying she had plenty of protections in the security housing unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lobbying efforts did not stop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 1998, the warden again asked for an out-of-state transfer for “protective custody and safety needs.” Tarpley had informed the prison that the victim’s family would use its sway with U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez to get the transfer approved, according to a Valley State Prison memo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, the state offered Ripple a transfer to a Florida prison. She turned it down, saying she had enemies there. Her hopes for a transfer to the federal system faded, and her medical records show worsening psychiatric problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March 2001, a mental health worker at the prison wrote that Ripple was “upset with the DA’s office as they had apparently told her that she would be sent to the federal prison in the past.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MONEY FROM DETECTIVE &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to what the Abel jury heard, Ripple did not return for long to Valley State. Eight years after the trial, she was housed at CIW, the San Bernardino County penitentiary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was far from a model inmate. By 2005, CIW officials were trying to get her transferred out of the facility and into one with higher security. They believed Ripple was supplying razor blades to other inmates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As he looked into Ripple’s file, Lt. Brian Pahel, a Department of Corrections investigator, learned that she was receiving the quarterly packages, including $20 and $40 money orders, from Tarpley. Another prison employee told him that she was at CIW at the request of Tarpley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarpley found out about the proposed transfer and called Pahel, asking that Ripple be kept at CIW, Pahel later wrote. Days later, Pahel heard from Lew Rosenblum, the Orange County prosecutor on the Abel case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rosenblum “expressed concern that if Ms. Ripple recanted her testimony, Mr. Abel’s case would end up back in court,” Pahel wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Pahel had had enough. In March 2005, he banned Tarpley from CIW without the consent of the warden. He wrote that if Tarpley was so concerned about Ripple’s safety, he should not have been sending her packages marked with Tustin police insignia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pahel’s complaints spurred an investigation by the California Attorney General’s Office, which was conducted by the California Bureau of Investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarpley told CBI agents he had first sent petty cash from the Tustin Police Department, then used his own money, according to a transcript of the interview included in Abel’s state Supreme Court records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The detective estimated sending several hundred dollars’ worth of money orders and packages from 1997 to 2005. But he insisted the money was tied to Ripple’s post-trial cooperation with other agencies on their cases. He cited her role in a Department of Corrections internal investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There was some personal risk for her to do that and that was all at my encouraging,” he told the agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He said he did not tell his bosses that he was sending his own money because they had already approved using petty cash. “It was probably the wrong decision that I made at the time, but I just decided, hey, I’m gonna take care of this on my own,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The agent asked if Tarpley, as a cop, felt “odd” sending an inmate his personal money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Well, no, I didn’t,” Tarpley said. “I felt that she had done what we had asked of her – and I’m not referring to the John Abel case. I’m referring to her cooperation in terms of this internal affairs investigation and then other cases or other information she provides down the road.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarpley, now retired, told the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Register in a recent interview he never faced any sanctions as a result of the inquiry. He agreed to talk generally about the case but declined to discuss the money in greater detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘DONE CASE’ &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abel’s appeal remains pending before the California Supreme Court, which rejected his first, automatic appeal in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tarpley told the Register that he believes Ripple changed her story because she is scared. Abel, he said, is a hardened criminal who got caught. He had racked up more than a dozen armed robbery convictions, court records show, and was an admitted heroin and cocaine addict who had run up big gambling debts in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s not the poster boy for reforming the criminal justice system,” said Tarpley, who added his only regret is not getting enough evidence against several people he suspects of helping Abel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a letter to a Register reporter, Ripple said that Abel is “not an innocent victim.” She said he and another man played a role in the murder of Miller, though “neither actually pulled the trigger.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The triggerman, by Ripple’s account, was Robert Chase, a former associate of both her and Abel. In 2008, Chase signed a confession saying that he shot Miller. Chase, a convicted murderer, gave the statement to Abel’s defense team just before he died in prison from health problems. Law enforcement dismissed the confession as a dying man’s favor to a former associate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ripple, now housed at Central California Women’s Facility in Chowchilla, agreed in her letter to an interview to discuss the Abel case “and the beauty, and nightmare of circumstantial evidence.” But prison officials said Ripple was being disciplined and had lost her visiting privileges until July.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors now downplay the significance of Ripple’s testimony in the case. In its recent response to Sanders’ filings, the Orange County District Attorney’s Office said the Abel case was irrelevant, in part because there was evidence other than Ripple’s testimony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There was no forensic evidence, but prosecutors say other details add up. Abel had a personal connection to the Miller family. He matched the original description of parking lot witnesses. And there were two eyewitnesses who picked him out of a lineup, four years after the crime. One of these eyewitnesses declined to identify Abel in the courtroom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During Abel’s trial, the prosecutor appeared to anticipate jurors’ misgivings about the eyewitness testimony. He made reference to Ripple’s story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If you believe Lorraine Ripple, (Abel) is guilty. That’s it. Done case,” he said. “One witness is sufficient to prove the case.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Daniel Escalera was on the hunt – and his weapon was the Bible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Locked up in the Orange County Jail, the habitual drug dealer and petty criminal spent time trolling for information. Of particular interest was the man in the adjoining cell, William Charles Payton, who was about to face trial for the rape and bloody stabbing murder of a young woman in Garden Grove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day after day, Escalera ingratiated himself with Payton, often during conversations about Christ. They read the Bible together.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Payton was unaware of it, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/rackauckas-689306-jacobs-letter.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Escalera was a jailhouse informant who would turn from cellblock friend to star witness&quot;&gt;Escalera was a jailhouse informant who would turn from cellblock friend to star witness&lt;/a&gt; in the penalty portion of Payton’s 1982 trial. His testimony about Payton’s “severe problem” with women and sex helped put Payton on death row 33 years ago for one of the most vicious crimes of the era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the old case looms as a battleground again, another in a spate of resolved cases that have drawn new scrutiny due to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/informants-693296-attorney-dekraai.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Orange County’s ongoing jailhouse-informant controversy&quot;&gt;Orange County’s ongoing jailhouse-informant controversy&lt;/a&gt;. The issue is whether prosecutors followed the law in disclosing evidence that they must make available to defense attorneys to assure a fair trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For Payton, now 61, the question is of mounting urgency. He is high on the list of condemned felons in California – and the next in line from Orange County – eligible to receive a lethal injection. Nine years after the last convicted killer was put to death here, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/death-691941-state-court.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;state officials this month unveiled a new, single-drug protocol&quot;&gt;state officials this month unveiled a new, single-drug protocol&lt;/a&gt; that could result in executions resuming as soon as next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“For almost two decades, we have alleged and the state has denied that Deputy District Attorney Michael Jacobs unlawfully concealed information that was favorable to Mr. Payton’s defense in order to secure his conviction and death sentence,” Payton’s habeas corpus attorney, Margo Rocconi, said last week. Even now, with Orange County informant issues spawning national news and law enforcement &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/attorney-693017-office-district.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;officials scrambling to contain the damage&quot;&gt;officials scrambling to contain the damage&lt;/a&gt; and adopt reforms, Rocconi said, the District Attorney’s Office continues to balk at turning over certain informant records as part of the legal discovery process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over the past five months, we have repeatedly asked the Orange County District Attorney’s Office for discovery regarding the informants in Mr. Payton’s case,” she said, “but they have produced nothing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan Kang Schroeder, chief of staff for District Attorney Tony Rackauckas, disputed Rocconi’s accusations, saying prosecutors will give Payton’s legal team everything they are obligated to turn over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Former prosecutor Jacobs, now a private attorney, responded that he followed the law and was vindicated in appellate court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I never willfully withheld any evidence in the Payton matter,” Jacobs said Sunday. “That was adjudicated in a federal writ of habeas 16 years ago. If she wants to relitigate it again, she may try,” he said about Rocconi, “but Payton has already exhausted his state and federal remedies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fight over informant records has been central to two high-profile death penalty cases awaiting trial in Orange County. One involves Scott Dekraai, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/dekraai-612380-salon-shot.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;who confessed to gunning down eight people at a Seal Beach beauty salon in 2011&quot;&gt;who confessed to gunning down eight people at a Seal Beach beauty salon in 2011&lt;/a&gt; – the worst mass homicide in the county’s history. The other is the case against Daniel Wozniak, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/herr-356467-wozniak-grand.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;a community theater actor accused of shooting two people&quot;&gt;a community theater actor accused of shooting two people&lt;/a&gt; in Los Alamitos and Costa Mesa in 2010 and beheading one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders, who represents both men, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/sanders-684780-attorney-case.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;touched off the informant scandal by digging into how so-called jailhouse snitches are used&quot;&gt;touched off the informant scandal by digging into how so-called jailhouse snitches are used&lt;/a&gt; and tracked by prosecutors and the Sheriff’s Department, which operates the jail system. A series of hearings on the issue ended with a judge ousting the district attorney from prosecuting Dekraai’s penalty-phase trial, a decision that has been appealed by the state Attorney General’s Office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders, however, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/wozniak-689424-informants-sanders.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;lost his battle to remove local prosecutors from the Wozniak case&quot;&gt;lost his battle to remove local prosecutors from the Wozniak case&lt;/a&gt;, which is headed to trial in early December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Local prosecutors have conceded unintentional mistakes in the Dekraai case, but say the defense attorney’s broader misconduct accusations are reckless and wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a 752-page legal motion filed in August in the Wozniak case, Sanders cited the Payton death penalty conviction and the two informants involved as an example of what he called a “bottomless well of jailhouse informant concealment” by Orange County authorities dating back more than 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders contends that the complete story about the informants’ backgrounds and their close relationship with prosecutors never got to Payton or his defense team and therefore never was told to the jury. Those circumstances and a “low-energy defense” provided by Payton’s original attorney resulted in what Sanders’ legal motion describes as “an utter disaster for due process, in a case that has been playing out since Ronald Reagan was president.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payton was convicted of exceptionally brutal crimes. Physical evidence and eye-witness testimony tied him to the rape and murder of Pamela Montgomery, a 21-year-old woman stabbed a dozen times at a home in Garden Grove. Payton also was convicted of trying to murder two others who were present in the hours before dawn in May 1980: Patricia Pensinger, who survived 40 stab wounds, and Pensinger’s 10-year-old son, Blaine, who was stabbed 23 times but lived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key question from the outset was whether Payton would be sentenced to death. Escalera’s testimony, coupled with the heinous nature of the crime and testimony from other witnesses, including one of Payton’s ex-girlfriends, prevailed over the defense’s argument that Payton’s life should be spared because of his religious transformation, according to a case summary prepared by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Escalera testified regarding his jailhouse conversations with Payton,” the court noted in 2001, in rejecting one of Payton’s appeals. “In addition, Patricia Stone, Payton’s former girlfriend, testified that she had once been awakened with Payton holding a kitchen knife to her neck. He began stabbing her chest and arms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The defense presented eight witnesses, including Payton’s pastor, a deputy sheriff, four inmates, his mother, and the director of a religious organization that ministered to prisoners. They testified that Payton had made a sincere commitment to God, had a calming effect on other prisoners, and could help others while in prison through Bible study classes and a prison ministry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five years after that appeal – and nearly a quarter-century after Payton’s trial – Escalera signed a handwritten declaration in which he finally laid out the full scope of his work for law enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The 2006 declaration, obtained by the Register, indicated that he was not just any other cellmate. Besides being an informant for the Orange County Sheriff’s Department and District Attorney’s Office, Escalera also worked as an informant for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the FBI and the Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fullerton Police Department considered him so vital to its drug-enforcement operations that detectives provided Escalera with an apartment he used while out of jail, in addition to giving him free food stamps, according to the declaration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From 1977 to 1982, Escalera wrote, “I considered myself to be working as a government agent at all times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Escalera also said in his signed statement that he expected – and was later given – leniency for felony charges against him, including a 1981 armed robbery, in exchange for his informant testimony. “I knew from having testified in three cases before Bill’s that there is an unwritten rule that I would receive consideration for my pending sentences ... and I did,” Escalera wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Payton’s new attorney, Rocconi, has obtained the declarations, but she still wants prosecutors to turn over Escalera’s Criminal Informant Index card, or CII, which could indicate, for example, whether Escalera was considered a reliable informant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although Payton has exhausted his death-penalty appeals, Rocconi said she may seek to reopen the case and is weighing legal action against the District Attorney’s Office for failing to make full disclosures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The Orange County District Attorney’s Office should not be in the business of concealing evidence or winning at all costs,” Rocconi said. “The mission statement of the Orange County District Attorney’s Office is to enforce the law in a just, honest, efficient and ethical manner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rewarding informants for their help is legal, but one of the judgments that prosecutors must make is whether giving an informant leniency – usually by forgiving crimes or reducing jail time – accomplishes enough to justify rewarding or sometimes releasing a known or suspected bad actor back on the streets, said Alexandra Natapoff, a Loyola Law School professor who has testified before Congress on the issue and wrote the book “Snitching: Criminal Informants and the Erosion of American Justice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of Escalera, the trade-off would prove disastrous to a gas station attendant and his family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Facing a felony charge for robbing and beating another man in a hotel room, Escalera might have spent years in prison, but former county prosecutor Jacobs and others signed off on a plea arrangement allowing Escalera to receive probation, according to the state Attorney General’s Office. Jacobs has acknowledged signing the plea agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Escalera, already released on his own recognizance, was allowed to remain free when the case ended – but only temporarily. A few months later, he got into a wee-hour altercation at a gas station, drew a gun and fatally shot station attendant Edward Rios in the neck, according to Los Angeles County Superior Court records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The star informant had become a killer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Said Jacobs: “It’s a prosecutor’s worst nightmare.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flowers piled up like a crashing sea wave against the west wall of Salon Meritage, where the shooting rampage occurred. Eight people were dead, another wounded. Loved ones wept and set about the grim task of organizing funerals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in mid-October of 2011, two days after &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/business-321651-medical-beach.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;the deadliest mass murder in Orange County history&quot;&gt;the deadliest mass murder in Orange County history&lt;/a&gt;, the strategic response of law enforcement began to take shape, publicly and behind the scenes. District Attorney Tony Rackauckas drove to Seal Beach and spoke at a news conference, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/salon-321997-killing-beach.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;vowing to seek death for gunman Scott Dekraai&quot;&gt;vowing to seek death for gunman Scott Dekraai&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With tears welling in his eyes, Rackauckas told reporters and TV crews that some cases “are so depraved, so callous, so malignant that there is only one punishment that might have any chance of fitting the crime.”&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://brutimus.github.io/snitches/articles/inside-snitch-tank-pt3&quot;&gt;Inside the 'snitch tank' Part 3: The care and feeding of a jailhouse informant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day later, outside the view of the cameras, sheriff’s deputies quietly moved Dekraai to a new location within the teeming Orange County Jail system: Cell No. 3 of Sector 17 in Module L, a psychiatric evaluation unit in the processing hub known as the Intake Release Center in Santa Ana. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://brutimus.github.io/snitches/pages/pano-irc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Go inside the Intake Release Center&quot;&gt;Take a panoramic look inside the processing hub.&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tank 17 would come to serve as a “snitch tank,” a place where investigators hoped to glean incriminating statements from Dekraai, a prisoner with no prior criminal record and no experience in the complex, Darwinian culture of the jailhouse. Aiding investigators in the effort would be a seasoned, street-smart gangster with experience as an informant. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://brutimus.github.io/snitches/pages/pano-mod-l&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Go inside Tank 17&quot;&gt;Take a panoramic look inside the “snitch tank.”&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrary to a common notion, snitches are rarely prisoners who just happen to overhear a confession. Jailhouse informants apply for the role, as if seeking employment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The gangster proved to be a good listener as Dekraai poured out feelings in conversations that jailers secretly recorded. But instead of nailing down a death-penalty conviction against a confessed killer who was arrested with murder weapons in his car, the bugging of Dekraai’s cell touched off a legal storm that has put Orange County at the center of a national debate over the use of jailhouse informants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Court hearings into the actions of deputies, investigators and prosecutors homed in at the very core of constitutional issues concerning the right to a fair trial. Out of the furor began to emerge a shadowy picture of inmate informants as a formalized evidence-gathering tool, with a roster of covert operatives, tracked in a database, who file handwritten intelligence reports on what they see and hear throughout the jail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A FORMER SURFER&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, an Orange County judge shocked the criminal justice community here by finding that key informant records were improperly concealed and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/attorney-654000-county-case.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;ruling that the District Attorney’s Office can no longer prosecute Dekraai&quot;&gt;ruling that the District Attorney’s Office can no longer prosecute Dekraai&lt;/a&gt; – a matter now left to the state Attorney General’s Office, pending an appeal of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;

Within a month, he filed for divorce, touching off &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/dekraai-321844-fournier-son.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;a rancorous custody dispute over his son&quot;&gt;a rancorous custody dispute over his son&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nerve damage caused him so much pain he could not even work a desk job. Dekraai was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, and his ex-wife later accused him of being physically abusive and exhibiting manic mood swings. A restraining order forbade Dekraai to carry firearms. He was two days shy of his 42nd birthday when he was transferred into tank 17 in the jail’s medical area, according to jail records obtained by the Register.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Angry and classified as a “total sep” in protective custody – meaning he was to be totally separated from other prisoners for his and their protection – he could not mingle even in the large, open day rooms adjoining each double tier of cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, the balding, 6-foot-1 Dekraai, who is listed at 285 pounds, fell into a fast and seemingly unlikely friendship with an inmate in the cell next to him. That &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/perez-603893-motion-dekraai.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;prisoner was Fernando Perez&quot;&gt;prisoner was Fernando Perez&lt;/a&gt;, a 30-year-old who was physically slight, just 5-foot-6, and unimposing, but nonetheless a rising figure in the leadership ranks of the feared Mexican Mafia gang. Perez was facing a third-strike charge of illegal possession of a firearm that could put him in prison for life, according to legal filings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than shun or ignore the hobbling mass murderer, who had killed his ex-wife and seven strangers, Perez nurtured a rapport, fetching water for Dekraai’s tea and affectionately calling him “buddy” and “brother,” court records show. The two men exploited a well-used, if terribly clunky, jailhouse communication device: talking back and forth through their sinks, letting the plumbing channel their voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A week after Dekraai’s arrest, at 5:37 p.m. on Oct. 19, members of the Orange County Sheriff’s Department, which operates the jail system, began recording the dialogue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An instruction in the inmate records, filed nearly a week after Dekraai’s arrival in tank 17, said he was not to be moved regardless of medical requests without the permission of special-handling deputies, who manage the informant network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 130 hours of audio tapes were made. By having Dekraai’s own words on tape, prosecutors and investigators thought they could avoid any suspicion that Perez was fabricating testimony about what he had heard Dekraai say, said Susan Kang Schroeder, Rackauckas’ chief of staff. In fact, they would have no need for the snitch to appear in court at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schroeder noted that a jury instruction commonly used in California warns, “Consider with caution any statement made by the defendant tending to show his guilt unless the statement was written or otherwise recorded.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;UNEASY ARRANGEMENT&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jailhouse informants represent an awkward dynamic: prisoners serving the very people who lock them up, risking brutal retribution – even death – in aid of the enemy. They break the code of the streets by offering up dirt on other inmates who are sometimes their friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Desperate to get out, they expect their treachery to result in lesser charges or reduced sentences for their own crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prisoners must interview for the job and, if accepted, they are logged into an informant database. Each informant is assigned to at least a pair of handlers who accept intelligence from them and guide their interactions with other inmates, said Lt. William Baker, who supervises the informant program for the Sheriff’s Department’s Special Investigations Bureau.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An informant must sign documents acknowledging that he is not a member of law enforcement and has not been promised any rewards in exchange for evidence they might collect, Baker said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite those disclaimers, some informants serve again and again over weeks or months, essentially functioning as spies for law enforcement inside the jailhouse. Some become prolific correspondents, court records suggest, filing dozens or even hundreds of pages of confidential notes – scrawled records in which the petty jealousies and political squabbles within and between gangs play out like never-ending crime dramas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually those records remain hidden from the public, even as they help further police investigations and bolster criminal prosecutions. The Sheriff’s Department keeps most of its informant operation well-concealed, citing an ongoing responsibility to safeguard informants and their families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one will say, for example, how many informants are housed among the nearly 6,000 inmates in the county’s five jail facilities. Prisoners suspect, rightly or wrongly, that the number is substantial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s like they’re breeding them here,” said David Neal, who was housed at the Intake Release Center where Dekraai and Perez had their encounters. Neal, who was defending himself against charges of carjacking and robbery, said of the snitches, “They are everywhere, dude.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker, who oversees the informant pipeline, described them as a critical tool for law enforcement and virtually the only means of penetrating the insular shells of gangs, drug cartels and the Mexican Mafia – the latter being a powerful faction in the prisons that also exerts strong influence over crime and drugs in the neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I could spend six months in an undercover capacity, living on the streets ... but I’m never going to get into that inner circle of these real criminal organizations – it’s just not going to happen,” Baker said. “These are very close-knit, closed societies. There’s a bond, a trust among their members. They grew up together, they commit crimes together, they go to jail together.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MEXICAN MAFIA BUSTS&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While gang homicides have dropped sharply from the 1990s, when the crack cocaine epidemic surged through urban districts, criminal street gangs still number more than 90 – with 5,000 documented members – in Santa Ana alone, said Carlos Rojas, the police chief of that city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santa Ana participates with the FBI, the District Attorney’s Office and other agencies in the Santa Ana Gang Task Force, which has mined informants inside and outside the jails to carry out two recent, high-profile crackdowns on the Mexican Mafia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Three months before Dekraai’s 2011 rampage, the task force’s Operation Black Flag resulted in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/gangs-308101-mexican-officials.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;indictments of almost 100 alleged gang members&quot;&gt;indictments of almost 100 alleged gang members&lt;/a&gt;, including two suspected kingpins, fighting for control of the Mexican Mafia in Orange County. Evidence in that bust included secret notes known as kites – thin strips of paper crinkled up tinier than cigarette butts and smuggled from cell to cell in the jailhouse – that investigators were able to confiscate, Sheriff Sandra Hutchens announced at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Operation Smokin’ Aces,” two years later, was another big sweep, resulting in indictments against 129 defendants as well as the seizure of 67 handguns and rifles and drugs. The case centered on Mexican Mafia operations and involved charges of murder, assault, extortion and racketeering, according to the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Informants in such cases have different motivations, Rojas said. “Sometimes it’s revenge. Sometimes it’s somebody that’s scorned,” the Santa Ana police chief said. “Sometimes they might want consideration based on criminal charges they’re facing. Sometimes it could be money. Any motivation that a human being could want ... could be in that spectrum.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Informants on the street often want police to give them money – sometimes thousands of dollars. In the jailhouse, some snitches command special treatment – cable TV, special deliveries of Del Taco – but the primary objective is freedom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Oscar Moriel, who would become a key figure in the task force investigations and prosecutions, was already in custody for attempted murder and other felonies – and desperate to avoid a life prison term – when he first contacted two Santa Ana police detectives in 2009 to discuss becoming a snitch. He would be putting his own life in danger, Moriel told the detectives, but knew information about unsolved gang murders, and he thought his memory might become even sharper &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/palacios-639481-moriel-informant.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;if police guaranteed him a deal&quot;&gt;if police guaranteed him a deal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“&lt;span class=&quot;soundcite soundcite-loaded soundcite-play&quot; data-plays=&quot;1&quot; data-end=&quot;285000&quot; data-start=&quot;0&quot; data-url=&quot;http://registerprojects.com/informants/moriel.mp3&quot;&gt;Right now I’m in a place with no options,&lt;/span&gt;” Moriel told the officers, according to a transcript of a recorded conversation obtained by the Register. “I’m looking at life in prison. So the more options I have to work with and to choose from, the better position I’ll be to think more clearly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although no deal was promised, Santa Ana detective Charles Flynn suggested that prosecutors would come through for him if Moriel proved helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“We use a word that we won’t get into but it’s called consideration,” the detective told him. “&lt;span class=&quot;soundcite soundcite-loaded soundcite-play&quot; data-plays=&quot;1&quot; data-end=&quot;74000&quot; data-start=&quot;0&quot; data-url=&quot;http://registerprojects.com/informants/consider.mp3&quot;&gt;You’re going to get consideration for the level that you perform.&lt;/span&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;MARKET FOR INFORMATION&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbnail inline-photo&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such tacit understandings are well-known to police, prosecutors and jail inmates alike, helping to create, in effect, “a massive, unregulated, sort of off-the-books market in which the government can trade almost any benefit in exchange for information and evidence,” said Alexandra Natapoff, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles and author of the 2009 book, “Snitching: Criminal Informants and the Erosion of American Justice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Supreme Court ruled, in a 1966 case involving then-Teamsters leader Jimmy Hoffa, that it is legal to reward criminal informants for information. For the most part, law enforcement agencies have broad latitude in deciding what favors to mete out, and many inmates are well aware of the chance to exploit the system for their own benefit, Natapoff said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information is the currency of the jailhouse, she said, and lots of prisoners seek to buy an edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The question is how reliable they are. Many inmates are only too eager to try to shift blame for their own crimes onto others if given a chance. Informants are believed to be the No. 1 cause of wrongful death-penalty convictions, based on a study of exonerated death row inmates conducted by the Northwestern University School of Law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under California law, Natapoff said, information from informants must be corroborated by other evidence to convict a defendant or prove special circumstances in a death-penalty case. Even so, false testimony, including bogus confessions, can be fabricated using a few known facts about a crime. Defense attorneys fear leaving paperwork with their clients, knowing that would-be informants might steal it to conjure a convincing fake story, according to the author, Natapoff, who has testified before Congress and the California Legislature on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“There’s a widespread belief out there that confidential informants are dishonest, unreliable and have credibility issues – and to some extent that’s true,” acknowledged Baker, the sheriff’s lieutenant. “But I’ve worked with informants for many years, and I’ve had some that were completely honest and completely reliable every time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stephen S. Trott, a senior 9th Circuit Court of Appeals judge and one of the nation’s top informant experts, is more cynical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“These are slinky guys, they are sociopaths, their objective is to fool me,” Trott said in a recent interview. “Informants know that to get out (of jail), you have to put someone else in. When you get information from a criminal, that’s when you go to work and too often police and prosecutors go to sleep.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;TRACKING 'INMATE F'&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders took on Dekraai’s case shortly after his arrest. He became aware that his client had been secretly tape-recorded as part of the legal discovery process – in which, by law, prosecutors divulge evidence ahead of time to the defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img height=&quot;250&quot; src=&quot;http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/mycapture/ny6xpj-b88558730z.120151121163407000gsldauvf.10.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 8px; float: right;&quot; width=&quot;205&quot;&gt;The discovery documents, however, identified informant Fernando Perez only as “Inmate F,” and it took months before Sanders could link the initial to a name. He learned Perez’s identity in the summer of 2012, eight months or more after the tapes were made, Sanders said. He was surprised to realize that Perez also was an informant against another high-profile murder defendant: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/herr-356467-wozniak-grand.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Daniel Wozniak, who is accused of shooting two people to death&quot;&gt;Daniel Wozniak, who is accused of shooting two people to death&lt;/a&gt; in Los Alamitos and Costa Mesa in 2010, and beheading one of the victims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders represents both Dekraai and Wozniak. In each case, the attorney is trying to stave off a death-penalty sentence. As he began digging into the subject of jailhouse informants, Sanders concentrated on two major issues that involve constitutional rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One was disclosure. Secrecy about informants, while helpful in protecting their safety, is an unlawful advantage to prosecutors, Sanders alleged. Defendants are entitled to know what deals informants are getting, whether they are reliable witnesses, and other facts that might be used to undermine their credibility – and they were not always getting enough of that information from Orange County prosecutors, Sanders said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second issue was about making a target of inmates to extract evidence or confessions from them – a fundamental purpose of the snitch tanks. The U.S. Supreme Court has interpreted the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees the right to legal counsel, to mean that prosecutors and police cannot ask questions of defendants once they have enlisted a lawyer, except if that lawyer is present or the prisoner has waived his right to an attorney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The law applies, by extension, to informants, if they are collecting evidence on behalf of the government. Informants are allowed to report what they overhear, but they cannot actively try to wrest facts or comments out of a cellmate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January 2014, Sanders filed a massive legal motion – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/sanders-684780-attorney-case.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;505 pages, accompanied by 15,000 pages of supporting exhibits&quot;&gt;505 pages, accompanied by 15,000 pages of supporting exhibits&lt;/a&gt; – alleging that the Orange County Sheriff’s Department and District Attorney’s Office flouted both laws in the case against Dekraai and in many other cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perez, the informant and Mexican Mafia member who gathered material on Dekraai and Wozniak, had sought evidence to bolster cases against dozens of other defendants, Sanders alleged. Altogether, Perez had slipped to his handlers “a couple hundred pages” of notes, according to the attorney. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://files.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/news/2015/11/perez_note.pdf&quot; title=&quot;2MB file&quot;&gt;View some of the notes in this PDF file&lt;/a&gt;.) The informant is now in federal custody.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He literally wrote down stuff every day,” Sanders said. “He was working off his life sentence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SNITCH AS STRATEGIST&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbnail inline-photo&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/mycapture/ny6xp9-b88558730z.120151121163407000geed02i0.10.jpg&quot;&gt;
	&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Jailhouse informants got creative in finding strategies to get inmates to talk and gather evidence against them. File photo: H. Lorren Au Jr.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other instances, informants made clear in their written reports that they were not just passively overhearing jailhouse talk, but were angling for ways to get their targets to talk. One such informant was Brian Ruorock, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/islas-654929-attorney-cases.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;who went as far as to act as a would-be strategist for his handling deputies&quot;&gt;who went as far as to act as a would-be strategist for his handling deputies&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that certain prisoners be moved, for example, or that microphones be placed in certain cells, to get the desired information, court records show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruorock, who entered the Orange County Jail system in 2011 on drug-related charges, would later admit, under questioning by a prosecutor, that he was involved in a federal racketeering case and feared going to a penitentiary for life. He sought to avoid that fate by helping the Santa Ana Gang Task Force in the headline-making Smokin’ Aces bust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His handwritten reports, obtained by the Register, are rife with gang gossip and breezy shorthand. In one, late in 2011, he wrote about strategies for gathering evidence against Bryant Islas, a man housed in Ruorock’s jail module who faced an attempted murder charge. Islas was accused of standing over a Santa Ana gang rival, Michael Salinas, and shooting him repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eager to arrange unhindered conversations with Islas, Ruorock suggested to his handlers that they transfer his cellmate somewhere else, because the inmate “was constantly telling (Islas) to shut up &amp;amp; has him spooked on recording devices &amp;amp; all kinds of way out ... paranoid” ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Islas would be alot (sic) more talkative” if his cellmate was changed, Ruorock wrote. Ruorock also wrote that “Islas trusts me &amp;amp; likes to try &amp;amp; impress me by bragging – Im (sic) fairly confident I can get him dead bang on the Salinas shooting &amp;amp; probably several others given the chance to get him talking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In another instance, Ruorock suggested putting a microphone in the cell of a known gang leader and expressed a willingness to aid sheriff’s deputies in secretly obtaining physical evidence against him by helping him write a kite to order a gang hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other informants employed equally creative strategies. Moriel, the snitch who first negotiated with Santa Ana detectives in 2009, thought he would have difficulty winning the trust of murder defendant Leonel Vega, a veteran criminal with the gang moniker Downer. So Moriel asked for his handlers’ help in creating phony paperwork – documents depicting Moriel as a problem inmate who had attacked deputies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Based on him reading my ‘paperwork,’ I’m being cleared of being a rat,” Moriel later wrote to his handlers. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://files.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/news/2015/11/perez_p13.pdf&quot; title=&quot;833 KB PDF file&quot;&gt;View a PDF version of the document&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He took a different tack against murder defendant Isaac Palacios. This time, Moriel thought he and Palacios, known as Slim, should be locked in adjacent cells in a disciplinary isolation ward, or “dis-iso.” No snitch would be punished by being thrown into isolation – or so the reasoning went.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t see a safe way” to get Palacios talking, Moriel wrote, “... unless we do the dis-iso thing again, which might work because Slim isn’t used to doing jail time, so he wouldn’t be as on the ball or suspicious as somebody like Downer who’s got years in the system. ...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inside the jails, barracks and modules are crowded. Thick doors, concrete and ubiquitous security monitors create a forbidding milieu. Prisoner movements are carefully controlled, and inmates wear color-coded wristbands to aid in segregating them appropriately and reducing the risk of violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First-time offenders, or “white banders,” typically are housed in large, open dormitories. Yellow-band inmates are repeat offenders, while orange- and red-band inmates are hardened career criminals – the latter are known to have attacked their captors – and thus are housed in high-security modules where they seldom leave their cells.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A substantial number of inmates wear blue bands, signifying protective custody. This group includes gays and some high-profile defendants and prisoners known by other inmates to have worked as informants in the past. All are likely prey in the violent criminal culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In preparing his death-penalty defense of Dekraai, Sanders discovered that sheriff’s deputies recorded inmate movements and the assignment of wristband colors – possible tip-offs, he believed, that an informant was being brought together with a target – on records that he identified in his motion as “TREDS.” These potentially important records were kept secret, he alleged, and virtually never turned over to defense attorneys, who usually had no idea they even existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;SURPRISE DECISION&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p class=&quot;caption&quot;&gt;Superior Judge Thomas Goethals. Photo by Ken Steinhardt, staff photographer&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judge Thomas M. Goethals, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/goethals-669116-judge-case.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;a former prosecutor and defense attorney with an affinity for Abraham Lincoln&quot;&gt;a former prosecutor and defense attorney with an affinity for Abraham Lincoln&lt;/a&gt;, took Sanders’ tome-like motion seriously enough to read it – and to order a series of hearings throughout 2014 into whether sheriff’s deputies and prosecutors in the District Attorney’s Office engaged in misconduct, as Sanders alleged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called TREDS became a pivotal issue. During their testimony, two sheriff’s deputies were so evasive about the records that Goethals concluded the two men “either intentionally lied or willfully withheld material evidence from this court.” The judge’s ruling in March held that the District Attorney’s Office, which bears ultimate responsibility for every facet of prosecution, was liable for any deception.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goethals’ written decision said Dekraai was unlikely to receive a fair trial unless the District Attorney’s Office was removed from the proceedings – and the judge ordered that recusal, igniting a firestorm of media coverage and an outcry from stunned prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baker, the sheriff’s lieutenant in charge of informants, said in an interview months after Goethals’ ruling that the records in question are part of the jail’s standard inmate-classification system, separate from the database of informants. They go back at least 30 years, he said, and were initially kept on heavy card stock and updated as inmates move from one cell to another, or in and out of custody. The actual term for them is “treads,” slang suggesting their continual reuse, as in retread tires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The tread record is not a secret – it never has been,” Baker said. Information on the treads, however, is “confidential,” meaning it is sometimes withheld to protect an informant’s safety. In some instances, a judge must decide whether the importance of revealing it outweighs the danger of doing so, Baker said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem with jailhouse informants, according to critics like Natapoff, who is a former federal public defender, is that the officials most directly in charge of ensuring the integrity of the system are the same jailers and prosecutors who are trying to win convictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anytime cases are fought or big constitutional issues are in play, points of view clash over legal gray areas. Like competing football teams, prosecution and defense push the limits of what is allowed, relying on the courts to play referee. Sanders argued in court that the secret bugging of Dekraai’s cell showed an intent by law enforcement to elicit information from him, thus violating his civil rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He won the point. At a hearing in April of last year, prosecutors chose not to fight and agreed not to use the recordings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those recordings – now sealed – could have offered objective evidence into Dekraai’s attitudes and mental competence for jurors weighing a possible death sentence, while also eliminating any chance that the informant Perez might have fabricated testimony, according to Schroeder, the district attorney’s chief of staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Generally, when an informant is used, it is best practice for law enforcement to have the conversation tape-recorded so that the judge and jury can judge for themselves whether the informant elicited the defendant’s statements, what the defendant said, and how he said it,” Schroeder said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While she noted that it is legal to intentionally place an informant next to a charged defendant and collect statements, “so long as the informant is a mere ‘listening post,’” prosecutors and sheriff’s officials say Dekraai and Perez ended up in adjacent cells by chance – and that the informant approached deputies only after Dekraai began talking about the crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dekraii has pleaded guilty to the murders, but a jury will be asked to decide his punishment at a death-penalty trial at least a year away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What detectives and prosecutors didn’t know in the immediate aftermath of the murders – and one reason for planting a bug in Dekraai’s cell – was whether he would pursue the same legal strategy as Orange County’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/-41796--.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;second-deadliest mass murderer, Edward Charles Allaway&quot;&gt;second-deadliest mass murderer, Edward Charles Allaway&lt;/a&gt;, who pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defense worked for Allaway, who shot seven people to death in a library basement at Cal State Fullerton in 1976. He avoided death row and life in prison without parole and is now housed at Patton State Hospital, a psychiatric facility in San Bernardino. The possibility that Allaway could be back on the streets someday hangs over everyone who was involved in the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the years, Allaway has petitioned to go free, claiming he is cured and no longer dangerous, said Dan Wagner, head of the District Attorney’s Homicide Unit, who has worked to keep him locked up. Allaway is eligible to try every year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He could file any day,” Wagner said. “He could file today, he could file tomorrow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;CONVICTIONS UNRAVEL&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders filed a motion in the Wozniak case 752 pages long – another “eye-bleeder,” in the words of one adversary. He submitted the challenge in August seeking to strike the death penalty and have the District Attorney’s Office removed from that case, as well. A different judge rejected both requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But by then the Dekraai ruling was having profound effects throughout the Orange County criminal justice system. Every defense attorney who had lost a major case involving informants was wondering if the results might be different now. A number of high-profile cases fell apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ruorock had been an important jailhouse source. The ex-gang member, who later applied for the witness protection program – his present whereabouts are unknown – helped investigators learn about guns being stashed in the door panels of a car, about an inmate admitting that he had stabbed a deputy, and a hit being placed on a gang member inside the jailhouse, according to one legal filing by Sanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But only days after Judge Goethals’ ruling in March, the prosecution of Bryant Islas for attempted murder – for which Ruorock gleaned jailhouse intelligence – ran aground. The defendant faced a possible life sentence. Instead, prosecutors offered and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/islas-679349-informant-attorney.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Islas accepted a plea deal that will free him next year&quot;&gt;Islas accepted a plea deal that will free him next year&lt;/a&gt; – a development that defense attorney Laurence Young said “clearly” reflected the problems with informants and withholding of evidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deputy District Attorney Erik Petersen, who prosecuted the case, denied at the time that informant issues played a role in the Islas settlement. But Petersen, once a key lawyer in the district attorney’s push against the Mexican Mafia, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/petersen-681635-attorney-district.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;resigned in September amid heat over informant questions&quot;&gt;resigned in September amid heat over informant questions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two of the big cases involving informant Oscar Moriel also encountered problems. The 2010 murder conviction of Vega, whom Moriel tried to dupe with phony jail paperwork, was dismissed in June 2014 – as allegations in the informant controversy were still emerging – because prosecutors failed to disclose 190 pages of notes to defense lawyers. Vega ultimately was given 15 years for his crime. Because of time served, he will be eligible for release after four years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gang member Palacios, who admitted to killing a rival by pulling the trigger 15 times as the victim lay dying in a Santa Ana driveway, fared even better. Facing a possible life sentence in prison, he instead was given credit for time served and was released last fall because informant evidence was not disclosed as required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;FIXING THE SYSTEM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;thumbnail inline-photo&quot;&gt;
	&lt;img class=&quot;img-responsive&quot; src=&quot;http://images.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/mycapture/nlcbzv-b88358884z.120150316221421000geh8i8to.50.jpg&quot;&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;District Attorney Tony Rackauckas &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/use-670384-informants-attorney.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;has conceded that mistakes were made&quot;&gt;has conceded that mistakes were made&lt;/a&gt; – unintentionally – and said his office has tightened the rules on how prosecutors will use jailhouse informants from now on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But many legal activists want a fuller accounting of the office’s practices. More than three dozen ex-prosecutors and legal experts, including former Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti and former California Attorney General John Van de Kamp, wrote a letter Wednesday declaring a “crisis” in the Orange County justice system and calling for a U.S. Justice Department investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The habeas attorney for convicted killer William Payton, who is on death row and scheduled to be the next person from Orange County to die by lethal injection, signaled this month that she plans to take legal action against the District Attorney’s Office, if necessary. She is trying to obtain information still being withheld – 35 years later – about key informants in the 1980 rape and murder case, which occurred in Garden Grove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Over the past five months, we have repeatedly asked the Orange County District Attorney’s Office for discovery regarding the informants in Mr. Payton’s case, but they have produced nothing,” said attorney Margo Rocconi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Schroeder, however, said the District Attorney’s Office will furnish all evidence the defense is entitled to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Scrambling to control damage, both the District Attorney’s Office and the Sheriff’s Department have instituted changes in recent months. Rackauckas, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/rackauckas-654482-attorney-case.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;an elected officeholder since 1998&quot;&gt;an elected officeholder since 1998&lt;/a&gt;, now vows to personally review all cases that involve snitches in the jail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One problem in making proper disclosures is finding and collecting all of the required documents – a huge challenge with so many jailhouses and investigators and thousands of cases moving through the legal system, said Baker, the sheriff’s lieutenant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To organize the effort, a single clearinghouse has been created, with a sergeant at the Intake Release Center now responsible for all documents and subpoenas, Baker said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Policies have been tightened, both at the District Attorney’s Office and sheriff’s headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If an outside agency – let’s say the Irvine P.D. – wants to conduct an operation where they want to introduce an informant to an inmate that’s in custody, previously they would call us and ... we would facilitate this meeting,” Baker said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that outside police department must keep a detective in the jailhouse throughout the operation, Baker said. That detective will conduct debriefings and write reports, not the jailers. The first two police agencies that asked for assistance after the stricter protocols were adopted both chose not to pursue it, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers in the District Attorney’s Office and virtually all of the sheriff’s nearly 2,000 sworn personnel are going through special training programs about informants and evidence. Assistant District Attorney Ebrahim Baytieh conducted a recent four-hour session for sheriff’s deputies, hitting hard on themes of integrity and full disclosure and emphasizing the dangers of relying on informants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baytieh showed a “60 Minutes” segment about notorious jailhouse snitch Leslie Vernon White, who emerged during a similar scandal in Los Angeles in the 1990s. In the film clip, White admitted to pretending to be a homicide cop and making phone calls to police and prosecutors to gather facts about cases. He used the intelligence to make persuasive claims about overhearing confessions, all in a bid to negotiate lighter sentences for himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s a marketplace,” a smirking White said on camera. “This is ‘Let’s Make a Deal.’ The only thing missing is Monty Hall.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Informants are liars until proven otherwise. Their allegations must be corroborated. Defendants have a right to disclosure even if they don’t ask for it, Baytieh told the deputies. One missing piece of paper ended up requiring the retrial of a man who murdered a police officer in Garden Grove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Baytieh showed slides of grisly crime scenes – an elderly man stabbed 83 times, a woman in her 80s who was raped, tortured and killed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even when the crimes make you furious, when you know the accused is guilty, when you know he’s a monster who shouldn’t be back on the street, when you are feeling your most cynical about justice, you need to follow the law or you’re no better than the crook, Baytieh said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It doesn’t matter how angry we get,” he said. “We wear our white hats in every single case.”&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;More than three dozen legal experts and ex-prosecutors on Wednesday called for a federal investigation into allegations that Orange County prosecutors and sheriff’s officials improperly used jailhouse informants and withheld evidence from defense attorneys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group, including former Los Angeles District Attorney Gil Garcetti and former Chief Assistant United States Attorney Richard Drooyan, penned a letter to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch calling attention to a “crisis” in the county’s justice system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Compelling evidence of pervasive police and prosecutorial misconduct in Orange County ... has caused us grave concern,” they wrote in the 25-page letter. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://files.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/docs/Request_for_Federal_Investigation_in_Orange_County_11.17.15.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;You can read the letter here&quot;&gt;You can read the letter here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It is fair to say that the criminal justice system in Orange County is in a state of crisis: charges in extremely serious cases have been reduced or dismissed; violent crimes – including murders – have gone entirely uninvestigated; to date, four law enforcement officers have refused to testify in pending criminal matters, citing their Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination; and at least one prosecutor has been found by a court to have given ‘incredible’ testimony under oath. More troubling still, this all appears to be the tip of the iceberg.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Susan Kang Schroeder, chief of staff for Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas, said the letter seemed to be cobbled from defense legal briefs and what she characterized as inaccurate news accounts, not from the complete court filings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our position has always been, and will continue to be, we welcome any scrutiny and input from any law enforcement agency who wants to come in,” Schroeder said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sheriff Sandra Hutchens also said her agency would cooperate with any federal investigation, although she added it would be prudent to wait for the outcome of the state probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hutchens said her department has learned from its mistakes. “During the court proceedings over the last several months, we have identified and acknowledged operational deficiencies and responded with immediate corrective action to include revised policies and improved training,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The office of California Attorney General Kamala Harris is investigating local prosecutors and police over the use of informants at Rackauckas’ request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The group of legal heavy-hitters is making the latest push for federal authorities to probe the two-year controversy over &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/sanders-684780-attorney-case.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;complaints&quot;&gt;complaints&lt;/a&gt; that Orange County authorities systematically misused informants&lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt;to illegally coax confessions from jail inmates who are represented by lawyers. Defense attorneys also have accused police and prosecutors of withholding background information on the informants and other evidence favorable to their clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. Department of Justice attorneys indicated they are “keeping an eye” on Orange County’s snitch controversy, according to correspondence between County Counsel Leon Page and the department’s civil rights division.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Among those signing the letter was former California Attorney General John Van de Kamp, who said the federal government no longer should watch from the sidelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Failure to turn over exculpatory evidence can lead to wrongful convictions. Without a comprehensive investigation, we’ll never know how many convictions were wrongfully obtained in Orange County,” Van de Kamp said. “At the same time, serious cases there appear to have been minimized by or tainted by the practices of the two agencies. In one case a defendant sentenced to life without parole for murder now faces less than four years in prison because of law enforcement misconduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He was referring to the case against convicted killer Leonel Vega, who faced a life sentence. Instead, prosecutors offered him a 15-year plea deal in February because of allegations that jailhouse snitches were improperly used against him. With time served, Vega effectively received a four-year sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the UC Irvine School of Law, also signed Wednesday’s letter and previously called for the U.S. Department of Justice to get involved. So did The New York Times editorial board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/goethals-669116-judge-case.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Judge Thomas Goethals&quot;&gt;Superior Court Judge Thomas Goethals&lt;/a&gt; cited concerns that the district attorney could not guarantee a fair trial for Scott Dekraai, who confessed to gunning down eight people at a Seal Beach salon in 2011. Goethals removed the office’s 250 lawyers from the death penalty trial, the largest mass murder case in Orange County history. The state attorney general is appealing the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;State prosecutors told Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas that his office might have a jailhouse informant problem in 1999, a full 16 years before allegations surfaced in court of misconduct involving widespread use of jailhouse snitches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The revelation surfaced in a trove of documents filed this month by Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders, who has accused Rackauckas’ office of routinely and illegally misusing jailhouse informants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The documents &lt;a href=&quot;http://files.onset.freedom.com/ocregister/graphics/INFORMANT_LETTER.pdf&quot;&gt;include a 13-page letter to Rackauckas&lt;/a&gt; dated June 16, 1999 from David P. Druliner, then state chief assistant attorney general.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In that letter, Druliner tells Rackauckas that Mike Jacobs, then the D.A’s chief homicide prosecutor, offered “contradictory” testimony about his use of a jailhouse informant. Druliner also wrote that Rackauckas’ office should start providing certain key information about confidential informants to defense attorneys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders says the letter should have warned Rackauckas about possible misconduct by his prosecutors and that it outlines strategies still used by Rackauckas for using informants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The leader of the office should have realized it was imperative to begin an investigation of Jacobs’ cases. It never happened and the local justice system may never fully recover,” Sanders wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rackauckas was unavailable for comment Monday. His chief of staff, Susan Kang Schroeder, said Sanders was trying to “bootstrap” an unrelated issue to the trial of Daniel Wozniak, who stands accused of killing two people in Costa Mesa in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When the letter surfaced (in 1999) it was determined (Jacobs) was not a good fit for head of the homicide department,” Schroeder said. “He was immediately removed from that department.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rackauckas fired Jacobs from the D.A.’s office nearly two years after the Druliner letter. Jacobs, now a private attorney in Irvine, did not return two telephone messages left Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kristin Ford, spokesperson for state Attorney General Kamala Harris, noted Harris was not in office when the letter was written and declined to comment. She also declined to discuss Harris’ current investigation of Rackauckas' office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his letter, Druliner wrote that Jacobs testified he wasn’t part of a plea agreement for an informant who helped secure the death penalty against William Payton, convicted of killing a Garden Grove woman in 1980.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Jacobs did participate in the deal, signing a form indicating he knew of it, according to court records cited in Druliner’s letter. Those records also show Jacobs was present at the sentencing of informant Daniel Escalera and that he participated in a confidential meeting with the judge – all of which Jacobs denied under oath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Druliner added that Payton’s lawyers believed prosecutors offered Escalera a secret deal, contrary to what Jacobs and Escalera’s attorney told investigators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Druliner noted that six days after Payton was sentenced to death, Escalera’s attorney wrote a letter to county probation saying, “Certain promises relating to Mr. Escalera’s continuing to work with law enforcement and (testifying) in the aforementioned superior court prosecution of Mr. Payton were discussed, which led to the ultimate plea of guilty by Mr. Escalera.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, Druliner said his office believed Jacobs and that there was no secret deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders is hoping the letter and other defense arguments will persuade Superior Court Judge John Conley to remove Rackauckas’ office from the Wozniak case and reject the death penalty for his client. A hearing on those issues continues today in Santa Ana.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, a Superior Court judge removed the 250-lawyer District Attorney’s Office from the largest mass killer case in county history, the shooting by Scott Dekraai of eight people at a Seal Beach hair salon in 2011. Charges have been reduced or dropped in four murder and attempted murder cases after Sanders alleged Rackauckas misused informants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Escalera eventually pleaded guilty to his second robbery and was given five years’ probation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next year, according to court records, Escalera shot and killed a man during a gas station heist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a Santa Ana courtroom, Orange County Sheriff’s Deputy Seth Tunstall raised his right hand to take the oath and stepped onto the witness stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You are employed by the Orange County Sheirff’s Department?” a defense attorney asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“After conferring with my attorney I’m going to decline to answer on Fifth Amendment grounds,” Tunstall replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tunstall was followed by three more deputies called to testify in a hearing on a gang-related murder. One by one, each deputy said the same thing: nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All four invoked their rights against self-incrimination, declining to reveal even the most basic information, including where they work and whether they attended a police academy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The refusal of the four Orange County sheriff’s deputies to testify this month means a Santa Ana man can’t receive a fair hearing in a case that could send him to prison for life, his attorney contends. The criminal case is one of many ensnared in Orange County’s jailhouse informant scandal, which this year prompted a judge to remove the entire staff of the District Attorney’s Office from the trial in the county’s worst mass shooting.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/prosecutors-686481-law-evidence.html&quot;&gt;After Orange County D.A. kicked off case from jailhouse informants, prosecutors face stricter standards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The latest legal challenge comes from Eric Ortiz, a 26-year-old gang member convicted in January for a 2011 fatal shooting in Santa Ana. Before Ortiz could be sentenced, however, Superior Court Judge Richard King granted him a hearing on whether he should receive a new trial based on disclosures about the use of a jailhouse snitch in his prosecution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rudolph Loewenstein, Ortiz’s defense attorney, contends four deputies – Tunstall and colleagues Benjamin Garcia, William Grover and Bryan Larson – possess key information as to how authorities violated Ortiz’s constitutional rights by using an informant to gather incriminating statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in a weeklong hearing this month, the case hit a snag when the four deputies invoked their Fifth Amendment rights. All four came to court with their own defense attorneys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s shocking that we have members of law enforcement sworn to uphold the law and they’re refusing to testify because their answers might incriminate them,” Loewenstein said. “If that doesn’t shake the public’s faith in the system, I don’t know what does.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Peace officer rights &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attorney noted that King also has said the deputies have relevant information about the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is not yet clear whether the deputies will face any repercussions for refusing to testify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Orange County Sheriff Sandra Hutchens said in a statement the department is reviewing the circumstances behind each deputy’s decision and will “pursue additional investigations and manage assignments as needed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I take the matter very seriously and have a number of concerns as I continue to monitor and review the facts emerging across different investigations and court cases,” Hutchens said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tom Dominguez, president of the Association of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs, said peace officers are afforded the same constitutional rights as all citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“They do not lose those constitutional protections when they pin on the badge,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Fifth Amendment fully applies to law enforcement, but it’s “exceptionally rare” for a police officer or deputy to invoke the Fifth Amendment as a witness in a criminal case, said Larry Rosenthal, a law professor at Chapman University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Ortiz case, Rosenthal said, is additional fallout from the “sloppy handling of informants” by the District Attorney’s Office. “The office has jeopardized what may turn out to be dozens of very serious cases from their own carelessness,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several cases have now been affected by disclosures alleging prosecutors and police improperly used jailhouse informants and withheld evidence. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/sanders-684780-attorney-case.html&quot;&gt;Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders&lt;/a&gt; and other defense attorneys are challenging many others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two other murder cases and two attempted-murder cases have resulted in plea deals and reduced sentences in the wake of the scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Death penalty trial stalled &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an unprecedented move in March, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ocregister.com/articles/goethals-669116-judge-case.html&quot;&gt;Superior Court Judge Thomas Goethals&lt;/a&gt; removed the entire District Attorney’s Office from the penalty phase for the trial of Scott Dekraai, who admitted killing eight people at a Seal Beach salon in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his ruling, Goethals said deputies Tunstall and Garcia, who both worked in the Orange County Jail as part of a special handling unit, “either intentionally lied or willfully withheld material evidence” about the existence of so-called TRED records, which log movements of inmates, including jailhouse informants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Authorities have not said whether the deputies will face possible charges as a result of their testimony in the Dekraai case. District Attorney Chief of Staff Susan Kang Schroeder deferred questions to the state Attorney General’s Office, which is investigating the matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tunstall, a 14-year veteran and a statewide expert on the Mexican Mafia, was the first deputy called to testify in the Ortiz case&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;on Oct. 6. He declined to answer all questions under oath.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tunstall also has refused to testify as a key witness in cases involving the Mexican Mafia, which has forced prosecutors to reconsider charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following the testimony, King asked how basic questions on Tunstall’s professional background could lead to self-incrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What crime would his testimony reveal that he would be subject to criminal liability?” the judge asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In response, Tunstall’s attorney Paul Meyer said foundational questions on Tunstall’s employment are “links in a chain” that lead to areas where he could raise the Fifth Amendment “without any question.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meyer noted that invoking constitutional rights is not an admission of wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“A witness who takes the Fifth or invokes the Fifth Amendment is doing so based on a possibility of a possible theory, even if it’s disputed and it’s not well established in fact,” he said in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Waiting for the appeals &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge ruled Oct. 8 that all four deputies had met their burden of proof to invoke the Fifth Amendment because of possible exposure to charges of perjury and obstruction of justice related to the Dekraai case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meyer, in a statement, said the deputies were all advised by their attorneys to invoke their rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“While we believe that Judge Goethals’ ruling will be proven wrong by the appellate courts, and by the facts, an invocation of rights was the right call until the pending investigations are concluded,” Meyer said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ortiz was arrested in 2011, five years after the shooting death of Emeterio Adame, 51, outside a home in Santa Ana. When a key witness fell through before the trial, Loewenstein contends authorities conspired to place Ortiz next to informant and convicted burglar Donald Geary inside the Orange County Jail to gain incriminating statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the Massiah rule, authorities are barred from attempting to elicit incriminating statements from a suspect who is already represented by an attorney.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Geary, who testified in the case, said he was not prompted by law enforcement to question Ortiz. Both prosecutors who handled the case, Eric Peterson and, more recently, Seton Hunt, denied any misconduct in the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ortiz is due back in court Oct. 30, when King will hear final arguments. The judge is then expected to issue a ruling on whether to move forward with sentencing or grant the defense’s request for a new trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;District Attorney Tony Rackauckas has said his prosecutors made “missteps” but said those were not intentional. Rackauckas in the past year conducted an in-house investigation that has resulted in office changes to better track the use of informants. Rackauckas also has enlisted a committee of legal experts to review his office’s use of jailhouse informants. The committee’s findings are due by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;Is Scott Sanders the most polarizing man in Orange County?&lt;/h1&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man who is shaking the Orange County legal system to its bedrock comes across with a decisive confidence, like the math whiz in high school who knew every answer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney Scott Sanders can be charming, even funny, but in court he is strong-willed and rather tightlywound.&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;He is known to trudge the short distance from his office to the Santa Ana courthouse sporting an Indiana Jones-style expedition hat. Youthful at 48, Sanders wears his hair longish and rolls up the sleeves of his white dress shirts. With his trim beard and wire-frame glasses, he looks, one attorney said, like a defense lawyer from central casting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a member of the felony unit at the Orange County Public Defender’s Office, where he has worked for 22 years, Sanders has emerged as a lightning rod for controversy for exposing entrenched problems in how Orange County prosecutors and law enforcement agencies used jailhouse informants to build their cases against defendants while withholding evidence from defense attorneys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scandal continues to draw national and even international attention, with The New York Times, Washington Post and “60 Minutes” joining a barrage of coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders’ dogged efforts to unearth abuses has made him the bane of the Orange County District Attorney’s Office, which has been barred from prosecuting the biggest mass-murder case in the county’s history: the shooting deaths of eight people at a Seal Beach beauty salon in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Sanders was at it again, holding forth before Superior Court Judge Gregg Prickett, expounding on the subject of informants by drawing heavily from his latest legal motion – a document he filed this month chronicling 30 years of alleged abuses in a whopping 754 pages. Sanders’ presentation seemed to amount to a filibuster while his adversary with the District Attorney’s Office glared at him with disdain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He gets and deserves no respect,” said Mark Geller, a senior deputy district attorney who has been a target of Sanders’ sweeping accusations against prosecutors. “Scott Sanders shouldn’t even be a lawyer based on the tactics he’s engaged.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anti-Sanders sentiment is at least equaled by the fervor of his supporters. Jeff Adachi, San Francisco’s public defender, summed up the viewpoint of Sanders’ admirers by saying: “Scott Sanders has become a folk hero.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Questioning the system &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least four murder and attempted murder cases have unraveled in the past year due to problems with informants and evidence disclosure uncovered by Sanders, and more cases, including some involving men on California’s death row, are being reviewed or questioned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“How many other places is this happening? How many innocent people might have been railroaded in this kind of system and it hasn’t been discovered?” asked David Greenwald, executive director of the People’s Vanguard of Davis, a nonprofit group that monitors the justice system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Greenwald invited Sanders to give a keynote speech at a November fundraiser and take part in a paneldiscussion about prosecutorial abuses. He said many of those who attended – the crowd was thick with defense lawyers – seemed “blown away” by what one man had accomplished in challenging the government’s powerful legal machinery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s hard to imagine that Orange County is worse than anywhere else,” Greenwald said. “You’ve got to imagine there are all sorts of shenanigans going on. D.A.s need to get their convictions to stay in office. The incentive structure is poor; it sets things up for misconduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Laura Fernandez, a senior fellow at Yale Law School who studies prosecutorial misconduct, said, “Many people have observed that what sets Orange County apart – aside from the profound, systemic and longstanding nature of the misconduct there – is the presence of an attorney and an office willing to take on the system they are part of.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The magnitude of Sanders’ impact stands out in even sharper relief when viewed against the gray masses of public defense lawyers, on the whole a downtrodden and overburdened lot. The Orange County Public Defender’s Office, which has a budget of $72.6 million, handles some 79,000 cases a year with a staff of 211 attorneys, according to Public&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Defender Frank Ospino, who is Sanders’ boss. Criminal defendants are assigned to the office if they cannot afford to hire private counsel. Many are gang members, indigents and repeat offenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typically, the office’s attorneys churn through hundreds of cases, negotiating plea deals whenever they can avoid trial. Defeat is such a common result that one lawyer described measuring success by how long he could cause a jury to deliberate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tabulating a won-lost percentage is a fuzzy proposition, Ospino pointed out in a brief interview, because even when a conviction is handed down there may be an element of victory in getting a murder charge reduced to involuntary manslaughter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legal motions filed by attorneys seldom exceed 50 pages, even in murder trials. Sanders has written motions – “eye-bleeders,” prosecutors called them – that are 10 times that length.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Defending a mass murderer &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When assigned to Scott Dekraai, the admitted killer in the Seal Beach salon massacre, Sanders was saddled with a near-certain loser. After all, Dekraai, 41 at the time and a former tugboat crewman, confessed to the shooting spree in which his ex-wife was a victim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only legal issue was, and remains, whether he would receive the death penalty – a sentence that, in California, is for now at least largely academic because of a statewide moratorium on capital punishment. No one has been executed here since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite that, Dekraai became the focal point of a bare-knuckles legal fight that is still not resolved after four years of court hearings punctuated by anguished demands by the families of the victims for justice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anticipating a possible insanity defense, prosecutors and investigators tried to bolster their case for death by enlisting the help of a regular jailhouse informant named Fernando Perez, who, over six days in October 2011, used a wire to record more than 100 hours of conversations with Dekraai inside the Orange County Jail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders, upon learning of the covert recordings, responded by delving into the murky realm of jailhouse informants. Under federal law, suspects are shielded from questioning if they have retained a lawyer and been charged with a crime. Jailhouse informants are generally allowed to offer testimony about what they happen to hear, but they cannot interrogate defendants on behalf of prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What Sanders found, he said, by filing discovery motions, was that Perez, a Mexican Mafia leader, was due to be sentenced to life in prison following a third-strike conviction in 2009 for illegal possession of a firearm. While awaiting that sentence, according to Sanders, Perez turned informant and essentially worked full-time collecting information on dozens of inmates, secretly passing along “a couple hundred pages of notes” to law enforcement agents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He literally wrote down stuff every day,” Sanders said in an interview. “He was working off his life case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From January 2013 – when the defense attorney received records on all of the cases in which Perez was an informant – until January2014, “pretty much all I did ... for every waking moment,” was to work on compiling the material, Sanders said. By then, he was able to file a 505-page motion supported by 15,000 evidentiary exhibits – enough paper to fill more than a dozen large legal boxes. The mass of material outlined what Sanders&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;alleged was an orchestrated effort by law enforcement to place known informants in proximity to high-value defendants. The movement of informants from cell to cell was logged on records known as TREDs that were kept secret and never disclosed to defense attorneys, in violation of disclosure laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;District Attorney Tony Rackauckas declined to be interviewed for this story, saying through his chief of staff that he would let his office’s court filings speak for themselves. Prosecutors have admitted missteps in a few individual cases, but say the defense attorney’s far-reaching accusations are simply wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suspected problems &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Defense attorneys tend to side with Sanders. “Many of us over the years have suspected there’s a problem,” said Kate Corrigan, a private defense attorney in Newport Beach and former head of the Orange County Criminal Defense Bar Association. The trouble was, nobody could ever show that such records existed – until Sanders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You know it’s got to be there,” Corrigan said of the TRED records, which played a critical role in a judge’s decision to oust the district attorney from the Dekraai case. But for years, Corrigan said, law enforcement officials denied them. “They were constantly saying, ‘They’re not there, they’re not there, they don’t exist.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders was able to undertake such an enormous research job in part because of his status as one of the public defender’s senior lawyers, Ospino said. Unlike lower-level deputies saddled with huge caseloads, Sanders, who makes more than $273,500 a year in total compensation, shares managerial duties as assistant public defender and has responsibility for only two defendants: Dekraai and double-slaying defendant Daniel Wozniak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wozniak is a former theater actor who was living in a Costa Mesa apartment house in 2010 when he was charged with killing a neighbor with the apparent motive of stealing the man’s money. He was accused of then using the victim’s cellphone to lure the man’s friend into an apartment and killing her, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That case resulted in Wozniak’s arrest just days before his scheduled wedding and made People magazine, which quoted him confessing, “I’m crazy and I did it.” Although Wozniak initially confessed to police, according to grand jury transcripts, he later entered a plea of not guilty. Sanders contends that in this case, prosecutors improperly used the same jailhouse informant who provided evidence against Dekraai. Prosecutors deny the informant was working for them at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Public Defender’s Office regularly assigns two lawyers to each murder case, Ospino said. Thus, Sanders works with attorney Lisa Kopelman on Dekraai’s defense and attorney Tracy Lesage on Wozniak’s. Sanders is the team leader in each instance and also has at his disposal investigators and paralegals, Ospino said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Outcry for justice &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A commonality of the two cases is that each has dragged on for years. And that has amped up the pressure on all involved – especially Sanders, who is regarded by some as an obstacle to any resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Victims’ families began voicing frustration years ago. Wozniak is accused of killing&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;Sam Herr, who was 26 at the time, and dismembering the body. Also killed was Juri Kibuishi, 23. Herr’s father, Steve, 67, watched virtually nothing happen for five years before encountering Sanders in June at the courthouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Our eyes met, I went up and said, ‘Look ... let’s get the trial going,’” Herr said. “And he told me, ‘Get the death penalty off the table and it’s over tomorrow.’ The way I look at it, that was like a threat. Scott Sanders is using this case to further his own agenda ... to prove he’s right, and the longer he delays it’s like a plus for his career, and in certain cases he might be right. But I’m focused on my son’s murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I don’t care about prosecutorial misconduct,” Herr said. “All I want is to get my son’s murder case off the books. All I want is to find out answers, and I’m not getting them because we keep getting delays after delays after delays.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mindful of grieving loved ones, Sanders is careful to avoid thrusting himself into the limelight in a way that suggests a pursuit of personal glory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He has commented publicly about legal developments in his cases. He refuses, however, to talk about his personal life and motivations. What’s known about Sanders’ background boils down to name, rank and serial number:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He grew up in the Chicago area, received an undergraduate degree at the University of Wisconsin and attended Emory University School of Law in Atlanta. He and his wife, Priscilla Monserrate-Sanders, co-founder of a Spanish-language program for youth, live in Long Beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Friends say he is an ardent basketball fan. With his Chicago accent, he often could be heard in the halls of the Public Defender’s Office holding court on whatever held his passion at the moment, whether it was law or the Chicago Bulls, recalled attorney Matt Missakian, a former colleague there who is now in private practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The ultimate digger &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Scott’s into checking everything and digging and digging and digging,” Missakian said, noting that the arduous, often-thankless job of defense work requires a lawyer to be “somewhat immune to difficult odds and difficult outcomes. Scott has that in excess of almost everyone I’ve worked with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders’ close friend Dave Swanson, who met him in the 1990s while they were both attorneys working for the public defender, said he believes Sanders is not motivated by trying to advance his career or win fame. What matters to him, Swanson said, is to protect the legal principles so vital to defending anyone accused of a crime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He wants to see things done properly, legally,” Swanson said. “He wants justice. He wants fair play. He wants integrity. And I think he saw none of those things” in the county justice system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While preparing his exhaustive motions, Sanders worked as many as 20 hours on some days, in Swanson’s estimation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s just a phenomenon,” Swanson said. “He’s just driven, tenacious. I know nobody else who could possibly have done this except Scott. Nobody. Maybe there’s somebody in this world, but I don’t know anybody who has the combination of drive, tenacity, the sense of justice, the intellectual capacity – all of those things in one person.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Attorney Case Barnett, a former colleague of Sanders now in private practice, said Sanders can be blunt even when his points could be expressed in more diplomatic ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The public defender usually gets steamrolled, and the most-liked public defender is the one who makes it easier for those around them,” Barnett said. “The system wants to crank through the next case and the next person and Scott won’t let it happen. ... He doesn’t understand giving up. You do what’s right, no matter the circumstance. If the rules aren’t fought for, they are going to start disappearing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Privately, Sanders can be engaging and likable. In the courtroom, he is a fierce adversary, energetic, excitable, his voice rising in pitch as he slams home his point. He displays an encyclopedic knowledge of cases past and present, and wields facts with cutting precision. He slices quickly through discrepancies, growing indignant when he is attacked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His obsessiveness has yielded mixed results, starkly illuminating the subjectivity and interpersonal politics inherent in a judicial system designed to impartially enforce the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A judge has enough &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, Sanders’ hard-driving style served only to frustrate Superior Court Judge James A. Stotler, who was then presiding over the Wozniak case. In an extraordinary move, the judge recused himself altogether because he realized he could not maintain his objectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When you were making your argument,” Stotler said from the bench, directing his remarks to Sanders, “I was thinking while you were speaking: I wonder if people in the audience are saying to themselves, ‘Why doesn’t the judge put a stop to this?’ And I thought, Well, I’m not going to put a stop to it. ... I’m going to let him dig his own grave.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Following a weekend of “soul searching,” the judge said he realized his reaction to Sanders “may be human nature, but it’s not appropriate judicial thinking,” so he stepped away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After Stotler withdrew, the Wozniak case eventually fell to Judge John D. Conley, a longtime former prosecutor who&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;also happened to be one of the targets of Sanders’ far-reaching crusade. In court papers, Sanders alleged that Conley pushed as a prosecutor to use an unreliable jailhouse informant in a 1979 case against a defendant who eventually pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and died in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The drama continued in court on Friday as Sanders sought to have Conley removed as judge. No decision was made, meaning there also was no opportunity to finally set a date for Wozniak’s trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Courtroom victory &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders fared vastly better in the courtroom of Thomas M. Goethals, the presiding judge in the Dekraai case. Goethals, who previously worked as a lawyer in both the District Attorney’s Office and the Public Defender’s Office, took Sanders’ huge legal motion seriously. The judge held months of evidentiary hearings in 2014 to probe law enforcement’s use of informants and prosecutors’ alleged failure to share evidence with defense lawyers in accordance with laws of discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In March, just six weeks after Stotler begged off, Goethals found that two Orange County sheriff’s deputies had either lied or withheld material evidence about the existence of TRED records, the logs of inmate movements – including jailhouse snitches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The judge stunned the legal community when he granted Sanders’ request to remove the entire District Attorney’s Office from the penalty phase of the Dekraai case. At the same time, Goethals rejected Sanders’ request to rule out the death penalty, which remains a legal battleground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What cannot be debated,” Goethals wrote in his March 12 ruling, “is the fact that serious, ongoing discovery violations continue to occur in this case. ...” The problems were “far worse than the court previously realized,” Goethals said. “In fact, a wealth of potentially relevant discovery material – an entire computerized database built and maintained by the Orange County Sheriff over the course of many years ... remained secret, despite numerous specific discover orders issued by this court. ...”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While Goethals saw no direct evidence that the District Attorney’s Office participated with police agencies in hiding information, the judge held that the district attorney bears ultimate responsibility for protecting the constitutional rights of the accused.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Certain aspects of the District Attorney’s performance in this case might be described as a comedy of errors,” Goethals concluded, “but for the fact that it has been so sadly deficient. There is nothing funny about that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Critics blast his tactics &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fallout from the decision has been substantial. Geller, the senior deputy district attorney, said he combed through Sanders’ motion in the Dekraai case and found 30 inaccuracies. He compiled a list citing the down-in-the-weeds machinations of numerous gang cases, some involving factual details, others personal interpretations of events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He was just absolutely reckless in the facts he was alleging,” Geller said. “He made glaring errors that with any amount of due diligence he would have realized were wrong. He engaged in character assassination. ... He completely crosses the line when he starts with accusations that could cost us our bar cards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prosecutor Matt Murphy, who has jousted with Sanders over Wozniak, wrote in a legal brief: “Mr. Sanders terraces conjecture, innuendo and piecemeal historical representations into distorted accusations. ... Many of the arguments are self-defeating on their face, while in others ... conclusions are simply not supported by logical analysis. Many of the historical representations upon which the defense relies are demonstrably false.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a written rebuttal to his critics Friday, Sanders said that a “focus on self-vindication instead of justice is the one consistent theme in the prosecution’s response” to his work. “As long as that remains the situation the criminal justice system in this county will remain unfair.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One prosecutor who took the brunt of Sanders’ informant crusade was Deputy District Attorney Erik Petersen, who was involved in three of the four criminal cases that fell apart because of Sanders’ disclosures. Petersen resigned this month and declined to comment on Sanders’ accusations that he withheld evidence from defense attorneys. However, one of those defense lawyers, Marlin G. Stapleton Jr., said Petersen, his former courtroom foe, was a “super-good prosecutor” who unfairly became collateral damage because Sanders failed to find the time to closely examine details of a gang-homicide case he singled out in one of his massive legal motions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If Petersen had possessed the evidence he was accused of withholding, Stapleton said, the prosecutor would have used it in court and won the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though Sanders disputes those assertions, Stapleton nonetheless applauds the job Sanders has done to help clean up the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s done phenomenal work, just busted his butt and worked around the clock on these issues,” Stapleton said. “He’s uncovered some real deficiencies in the way our justice system handles informants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“One amazing thing about what Scott has done is now we know what to ask for. The existence of those TRED records was denied for years. Now we know exactly what they’re called. We know they exist now. That is a huge advantage to us in looking for this type of misconduct.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders’ long days are likely to continue. A trial date for Wozniak is expected to be scheduled soon. Dekraai has been turned over to the state Attorney General’s Office for prosecution, but that office has appealed Goethals’ ruling and is seeking to have the district attorney reinstated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, defense attorneys throughout Orange County are examining old cases to find convictions that might now be challenged. Stapleton recalls a defendant he represented named Michael Lamb, who was convicted of murder in 2007 and sentenced to death in 2008, in part due to the testimony of a jail informant. “We felt we proved another person did the killing,” Stapleton said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Sanders, attorney Rudy Loewenstein is seeking a new trial for convicted murderer Eric Ortiz, who spent months in a cell next to a known snitch. Loewenstein counts himself among those who consider Sanders a hero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I wake up and worry about my cases,” Loewenstein said. “Scott doesn’t even go to sleep because he’s worried about his cases. ... People would be imprisoned for the rest of their lives but for the work he has done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Key events in the jailhouse informant scandal &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;October 2011:&lt;/b&gt; Eight people are killed at a Seal Beach beauty salon in the deadliest mass shooting in Orange County history. The suspected gunman, Scott Dekraai, is arrested shortly after the rampage. District Attorney Tony Rackauckas vows to seek the death penalty. The victims were Victoria Buzzo, David Caouette, Randy Lee Fannin, Michele Daschbach Fast, Michelle Fournier, Lucia Kondas, Laura Webb and Christy Lynn Wilson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;January 2013:&lt;/b&gt; Prosecutors plan to use secret jailhouse recordings of Dekraai describing the shooting as evidence against him. Deputy Public Defender Scott Sanders later files a motion to block their use in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;April 2014:&lt;/b&gt; Prosecutors agree not to use the jailhouse recordings after Dekraai’s defense contends authorities improperly obtained the secretly recorded conversations using an informant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;May 2014:&lt;/b&gt; Dekraai pleads guilty to eight counts of murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;August 2014:&lt;/b&gt; Superior Court Judge Thomas M. Goethals denies the defense’s request to bar the death penalty and remove the district attorney’s office from the case. The judge concludes prosecutors were negligent but not malicious when they failed to turn over evidence to the defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;January 2015:&lt;/b&gt; Sanders accuses the district attorney’s office and the Orange County Sheriff’s Department of misusing jailhouse informants in other cases and moves to block the death penalty against suspected murderer Daniel Wozniak. He is accused of killing two acquaintances in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;March 2015:&lt;/b&gt; Goethals removes the district attorney’s office from the case against Dekraai, ruling that authorities improperly withheld key information and maintained a secret system of tracking the movements of jail informants. The state Attorney General’s office appeals the judge’s ruling, saying it “lacks legal justification.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;July 2015:&lt;/b&gt; Rackauckas says he will assemble a committee of legal experts to review the use of jailhouse informants. The U.S. Department of Justice warns that it is keeping an eye on the district attorney’s office.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas M. Goethals, a devout man with a keen appreciation for history, wrote to the White House so that his wife, a professional decorator and three-time cancer survivor, could help put up Christmas decorations there last fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Volunteers climbed ladders and strung garlands, and after days of work, when spouses were invited to join a dinner with first lady Michelle Obama, Goethals delighted in roaming the halls and trying out couches where so many great leaders have sat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The veteran Orange County Superior Court judge was especially enthralled by the portrait of Abraham Lincoln hanging in the State Dining Room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“My husband is a Lincoln fanatic,” said Patty Goethals, noting that the couple’s year-old grandson is named Lincoln. “Anything to do with Abraham Lincoln and the Civil War gives him so much joy. So he was just in heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thomas Goethals now finds himself, less happily, at the center of a different sort of public battle rooted in questions of moral conscience and constitutional justice. The case, which has unfolded&lt;b&gt; &lt;/b&gt;in his 11th-floor chambers in downtown Santa Ana, involves the worst massacre in Orange County history – a 2011 attack in which Scott Dekraai, a one-time tugboat crewman, strode into a beauty salon in Seal Beach and opened fire, killing his ex-wife and seven others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No one doubts that Dekraai was the shooter. He was arrested only a few blocks from the scene and confessed to the crime. While in custody, however, and with other serious legal issues still looming – Was he legally sane? Would he be sentenced to death? – Dekraai was secretly tape recorded by members of the Orange County Sheriff’s Department using the aid of a jailhouse informant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A twist in the case &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tapes and related evidence led to a startling turn in the legal proceedings. Goethals, acting in March on information unearthed by Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders, took the extraordinary step of barring the Orange County District Attorney’s Office from participation in the trial’s penalty phase – a ruling now on appeal – and assigning the case instead to state Attorney General Kamala Harris.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;District Attorney Tony Rackauckas immediately denounced Goethals’ move as legally inappropriate. Tensions already were high between the D.A.’s office and the judge. Rackauckas’ prosecutors had spent most of the previous year steering cases away from Goethals’ courtroom, leaving it largely dormant for months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;National news media seized on the clash and the misuse of criminal informants. “Dateline” and “20/20” have filmed in Goethals’ chambers for segments that have yet to air. “60 Minutes” has had its cameras rolling there in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never heard anything like it,” veteran defense attorney Gary M. Pohlson, one of Goethals’ closest friends and his former law partner, said of the judge’s ruling, which fanned the flames of a broadening scandal about the way police and prosecutors have used informants in the Orange County jail system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least two other high-profile murder cases have unraveled due to practices laid bare in the Dekraai case – one involving gang member Leonel Vega, whose original life sentence in prison was cut to 15 years. Isaac John Palacios, a client of Pohlson’s who had admitted to killing a gang rival and faced charges of killing a second victim, was set free because information gleaned from informants was never properly divulged to the legal defense team, Pohlson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Law-enforcement actions caused a double-murderer to be released,” the attorney said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;The human factor &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides stirring debate about the role of jailhouse snitches, Goethals’ ruling was notable for upholding the rights of an admitted mass-murderer despite the immense legal and political power of the county’s prosecuting apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goethals vividly illustrates the human element inherent in the legal system. For all of the rules and ideals of blind justice, cases can break in unexpected ways. Results swing on the decisions and interactions of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Judges are just like everybody else,” said Santa Ana-based attorney Ron Brower. “They have personal leanings and opinions. Those come into play.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goethals, a Loyola Law School graduate who was appointed by then-Gov. Gray Davis in 2002 (he took the bench in January of 2003), is a man of relatively diverse background. He spent a dozen years as a defense lawyer in private practice with his former legal partner, Pohlson, and a dozen years before that as a lawyer in the Orange County District Attorney’s office – the same agency he so sternly rebuked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He is the rare jurist who has prosecuted a capital murder case, defended in a murder case and presided over a capital case as a judge. Goethals is known for helping to convict two of Orange County’s most prolific serial killers – Rodney Alcala and Randy Kraft, each of whom is awaiting execution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trim, clean-cut and a couple inches shy of six feet tall, Goethals speaks with a voice both clear and emphatic. He and his wife Patty, who met on a blind date while Goethals attended Loyola High School in Los Angeles, now live in Newport Beach. They have three grown children, including a son, Patrick, who is a lawyer in Long Beach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goethals declined to be interviewed because of the pending litigation. However, Patty Goethals described him as a physically active, outgoing person who at times is the life of the party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He’s always the loudest person in the house,” she said. “He loves to laugh, loves to joke.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Passion for sports &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goethals played football in high school – he was a blocking back in the old single-wing formation – and has been a runner much of his life, taking part for 14 years in the annual law enforcement relay race through the desert heat from Baker to Las Vegas, a grueling trek that once melted his shoes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These days, the 63-year-old judge only jogs, Patty Goethals said. “He calls it shuffling. He needs both knees to be replaced. He’s putting off having his knees done.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Were it not for his love of law, Goethals probably would have become a history professor, his wife said. He was raised in Glendale, the second born in a family of eight children. Despite the commotion of a crowded household, he seemed to earn A’s almost effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He majored in history at Santa Clara University but chose to follow the career path of his father Richard, a noted civil attorney, and his older brother Rick, who practiced law in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He has a photographic memory,” Patty Goethals said of her husband. “Tom can remember facts, details. We have a little ski boat we take out in the harbor – taking friends out on a cocktail cruise. He will talk to them about famous people who live on the bay, who ate at that restaurant, when that got built. He retains information so easily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goethals was 16 when his family bought a vacation house on the peninsula in Newport Beach. He became a body surfer and worked summer jobs as a city trash collector and as a submarine driver at Disneyland. He and Patty remain avid water skiers. They like to take their boat up to Lake Almanor, in the mountains near the Feather River in Northern California. They also travel to Carmel and to New York City, especially in the winter when the tree is up in Rockefeller Center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When home, they curl up on the couch and watch “Veep,” “Call the Midwife” and “Downton Abbey.” Goethals, who finds time to teach at Loyola and Whittier law schools, reads voraciously. Tom Clancy, Gore Vidal, Shelby Foote, Michael Shaara. He loves reading books about Winston Churchill, Patty Goethals said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the years since Patty’s first cancer diagnosis in 1988, Goethals has given her steadfast support, she said. “He’s my rock and I don’t know what I’d do without him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Staunch Catholics, the Goethals have spent 40 years attending tiny St. John Vianney Chapel on Balboa Island, where the judge is a lay eucharistic minister. “He will never miss a Sunday mass,” Patty said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a county known for its conservative bench, Goethals has had a reputation, until recently, of being tough on certain types of crime. Sentencing in Orange County regarded as considerably more severe than in Los Angeles County, said Brower, the Santa Ana defense attorney, who has spent 45 years practicing law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Judges often have discretion in what evidence they allow and in how they mete out punishment. In a narcotics case, for example, some lean toward ordering substance abuse treatment, while others favor incarceration, Brower said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“(Goethals) would always listen to treatment options – he was never closed-minded – but he’d come down more on the severe side in that kind of case,” Brower said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The attorney described Goelthals as being a “severe, no-nonsense judge” in dealing with domestic violence and other types of violent crime, as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Papering’ a judge &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers intent on winning in the legal system – prosecutors and defense attorneys alike – routinely keep notes, either mentally or in private files, about the roster of judges and their tendencies. In the California state courts, lawyers in a given case are allowed one chance to disqualify a judge without providing a reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practice is known as “filing paper on a judge” or “papering a judge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The risk, Brower said, is that you can get rid of one judge and get somebody worse. “If I paper this judge, where are they going to put me?” Brower asked rhetorically. “If you think you’re going to go to a worse place, don’t do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Years ago, when Superior Court Judge Byron McMillan ran the county’s main courthouse, the roster of principal trial judges was about split: “Half a dozen were regarded as more liberal, lenient, and half a dozen were regarded as more conservative or severe,” Brower said. McMillan made sure that any lawyer who papered a judge and appeared to be judge-shopping was sent to the courtroom where he least wanted to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You didn’t fool around with his assignments,” Brower said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Papering a judge is relatively uncommon and the District Attorney’s Office accepted its assignment to Goethals when the Dekraai mass-murder case entered the system after the 2011 shooting rampage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;100 hours of tape &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite overwhelming evidence that Dekraai had committed the crimes, authorities covertly recorded more than 100 hours of conversations between the defendant and a jailhouse informant – a tactic they chose to pursue even in a seemingly slam-dunk case because of expected legal jousting over Dekraai’s sanity and whether he should be given the death penalty, D.A. officials said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dekraai never filed an insanity defense and he pleaded guilty to the murder charges, meaning the only legal issue not yet settled is whether he should be put to death or sentenced to life in prison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“In theory, O.J. was a slam-dunk case,” said Susan Kang Schroeder, the D.A.’s chief of staff, citing the murder acquittal of O.J. Simpson in justifying the decision to tape record Dekraai in jail. “There’s no such thing as a slam-dunk case. You can’t leave any stone unturned.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the penalty phase of a trial, “anything and everything the defense wants to put on can be put on,” said Jim Tanizaki, senior assistant D.A. in charge of violent crimes. Prosecutors seek to be equally well-prepared in arguing the other side, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of jailhouse informants, long a tool in probing the insular culture of violent gangs and organized crime, is so fraught with risks to justice that California has enacted safeguards against abuses. Informants are supposed to glean only what a suspect volunteers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;A 505-page motion &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders, the public defender representing Dekraai, suspected it was more than a coincidence that a regular informant ended up in a cell next to the defendant. Fernando Perez, the jail inmate who helped authorities tape Dekraai, was a Mexican Mafia leader facing a third-strike life sentence for illegal possession of a firearm, Sanders said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Convicted in 2009, Perez was awaiting his sentencing – he still has not been sentenced – when he agreed to become a snitch in the summer of 2010, Sanders said. Through legal discovery, Sanders was able to obtain “a couple hundred pages” of notes, he said, showing that Perez worked virtually full-time helping law enforcement officials to collect information to bolster cases against dozens of defendants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He literally wrote down stuff every day,” Sanders said. “He was working off his life sentence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sanders sought to show a pattern by jailers of moving informants around and concealing a secret database of snitches that were part of an evidence-gathering network. His motion, first filed in January 2014, consisted of 505 pages, plus 15,000 pages of related exhibits. He accused authorities of “shocking misconduct” and an all-out push to obtain the death penalty against Dekraai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goethals not only read the massive filing; he initiated a series of hearings that began in March of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goethals at first refused to remove the D.A.’s office from the case, although he ruled in August that evidence-gathering “errors” committed by authorities reached “the level of misconduct.” He barred them from using the tapes against Dekraai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Subsequently, Sanders was able to show that jailers kept logs detailing the movement of prisoners and the reasons they were moved – records which, in theory, would track the placement of informants. Such records, known as TREDS, were routinely withheld from defense attorneys and, until Sanders introduced them into the courtroom, were never mentioned during the hearings by some of the Sheriff’s deputies assigned to moving inmates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When Goethals reversed course and decided in March of this year to remove the D.A.’s office from prosecuting the penalty case, the judge singled out two sheriff’s deputies whom he said “have either intentionally lied or willfully withheld material evidence from this court.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goethals’ written ruling also made note of the district attorney’s responsibility for the actions of law enforcement agents working for prosecutors. Some of “those agents have habitually ignored the law over an extended period of time,” the judge wrote, concluding that “the District Attorney’s continued participation in this prosecution will likely prevent this defendant from receiving a fair trial in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An unintended consequence of Goethals’ action is further delay in a trial that has dragged on more than three years already. It could take another year, attorneys estimated, to settle the legal appeal of the district attorney’s ouster. Grieving families of the victims were already imploring Goethals in the summer of 2013 to get the case over with – and the judge, while voicing sympathy, postponed a trial date for nearly half a year to give more time to the defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The inquiry into the tapes stretched on for an additional year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;‘Bad on sex cases’ &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throughout 2014 and early 2015, lawyers in the D.A.’s office filed paper to divert more than 50 unrelated cases away from Goethals’ courtroom. Schroeder, the D.A.’s chief of staff, denied that prosecutors were boycotting Goethals because of mounting frustrations in the Dekraai case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather, she said, certain prosecuting attorneys felt that Goethals was “bad on sex cases.” If the charge was sexual assault, Goethals was reluctant to admit evidence involving prior acts that might show a propensity for such behavior. “He would never let it in – or rarely let it in,” Schroeder said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Goethals was tough on prosecutors in some types of gang cases, Schroeder said. In a bank robbery, for example, if a shooting occurs, prosecutors would like to advance the argument that “killing someone is natural probable consequence of robbing a bank,” she said. Goethals was apt to keep out theories that might have a prejudicial effect on a jury, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“As attorneys, we’ll do ‘turkey shooting’ – get together and say, ‘The facts are X, Y and Z – how would you get that admitted?’” Schroeder said. Papering a judge is just part of that normal process, she said. “They’re trying to get the best results on their case. We’ve had, in the past, female D.A.s refuse to go to a certain judge because he would be unfair to female attorneys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“To say that our office has singled out Judge Goethals, it’s just not true,” Schroeder said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, in March, when the state Attorney General’s office announced it would appeal the D.A.’s removal from the Dekraai matter, Rackauckas instructed his lawyers to file paper on Goethals only if they could justify avoiding his courtroom, Schroeder said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Experts from throughout the country have chimed in on the subject of jailhouse snitches, who were a factor in nearly half of the known 111 wrongful convictions in capital murder cases in the United States since the 1970s, according to the Northwestern University Law School’s Center on Wrongful Convictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“The whole concept of jailhouse informants defies credibility,” Radley Balko, author of “Rise of the Warrior Cop: the Militarization of America’s Police Force,” wrote in a column in the Washington Post. “The very idea that people regularly confess to crimes that could put them in prison for decades or possibly even get them executed to someone they just met in a jail cell and have known for all of a few hours is and has always been preposterous.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Would-be critics of Goethals are in the difficult position of being loathe to speak – partly because of the looming litigation, and partly because few lawyers would dare criticize a judge who might soon hear their own cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sleeps like a rock &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goethals’ admirers are more forthcoming. Newport Beach attorney Kate Corrigan, former head of the Orange County Criminal Defense Bar Association, said prosecutors underestimated Goethals by assuming he would “rubber stamp” the results they wanted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Judge Goethals showed he takes his oath seriously,” Corrigan said. “He has an amazing moral compass ... and he is not going to put up with Constitutional violations of anyone’s rights, whether he’s a gang member or accused of capital murder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I’m confident he sleeps like a rock and his conscience is clear because he’s done the right thing,” Corrigan said, “and he knows he’s done the right thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Patty Goethals said it’s true – he sleeps soundly, though the intensity of the flak troubled him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It was difficult at first,” she said. “Tom worked for the D.A.’s office for many years and he loves the D.A.’s office.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He found some solace in emails from friends and supportive letters to the editor, which he would clip from the newspaper. He has always been good at leaving the job behind at the end of the day, his wife said. He sits and enjoys a glass of red wine, reading the paper while she cooks dinner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goethals enjoys tranquil moments tending his rose garden – “Tom’s passionate about gardening; he’s got a beautiful rose garden,” his wife said – and he has much to look forward to in the months ahead, including the arrival of a second grandchild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Goethals are forgoing their summer trip to the lake to attend seven weddings – most of which Goethals will officiate himself, Patty said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“If they’re good family friends, he likes to do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
